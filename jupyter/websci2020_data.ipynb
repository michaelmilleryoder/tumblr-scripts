IT has no other option now. - Master C The Blog: NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - EXIST TO SERVE is about the journey ObjectD will experience into absolute Objectification and Dehumanization. This Blog is curated by ObjectD and the intended purpose of these pages is to allow ObjectD an outlet to express ITs fears, difficulties in adjustment (to ITs future reality) as well as ideas of how ObjectD (and others) could be TRAINED and then USED. Thus, it is hoped that insight will be gained from these pages (and ObjectD’s own thoughts) that will help in their own quests to become or to consider such property themselves. ObjectD does experience fear and dread about ITs future... enduring pain and suffering as well, while waiting for ITs destiny to begin... when the reality happens, the actual life ObjectD once had... will irrevocably vanish! Upon that transition, ObjectD shall never again possess the freedom to choose in ITs lifetime. And ITs memories of those days gone by are forfeit and forbidden for the rest of ITs days... ObjectD is simply a thing... IT is NOT REGARDED AS A PERSON, IT does NOT HAVE OPTIONS, IT is NOT OWED ANYTHING, IT does NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS, IT is OWNED CHATTEL - PROPERTY! ObjectD will do whatever is demanded of IT. ITs identity and humanity will be forfeit. NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - IT EXISTS TO SERVE - IT SERVES TO EXIST. ObjectD cannot avoid going down this path... IT is simply EQUIPMENT, LIVESTOCK and PROPERTY... nothing more... and IT will be treated as such. It will take time for ObjectD to accept that ITs life is based upon simple rules: OBEY, TOIL, and BE USED. ObjectD has a long hard road ahead of IT now. Enjoy the blog! - Master C</td>\n",

Normal everyday people just don't get it, the automotive zombies that use a car just for transporting them from A to B. It is so much more, your pride and joy,  the smell of the upholstery as you open the door, the feel of the seat as you get in it, the grasp, the texture of the gear stick in your hand, the turn of the key in the ignition, the burble and roar of the engine as you fire it up,  the sensation of freedom you feel as you back out the driveway, the eagerness you have driving your chariot, your passion down the road. The pleasure and certainty you have taking off,  absconding with your vehicle far away from the every day, the worries and stress you leave behind. We capture, guard and enjoy a nostalgic piece in time every opportunity we get to leave the garage and do this. The euphoria of cutting loose, escaping mediocrity, hitting the road, going where your heart desires, just you and your machine because \"it's not the destination, the journey is the destination\"! Then when you find a partner or companion with a hunger and craving as voracious as you have, the desire, the thirst of all things automotive, Nothing and I mean NOTHING comes even close to this exhilaration of abandonment, when you can share this obsession, this adventure with another, who has the same enthusiasm as you do. To experience those long drive's on a starry night side by side, be captivated by the same encounter, cruising till the sun comes up, that is to live! Love the beast. Hope you enjoy my blog</td>\n",

IT has no other option now. - Master C The Blog: NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - EXIST TO SERVE is about the journey ObjectD will experience into absolute Objectification and Dehumanization. This Blog is curated by ObjectD and the intended purpose of these pages is to allow ObjectD an outlet to express ITs fears, difficulties in adjustment (to ITs future reality) as well as ideas of how ObjectD (and others) could be TRAINED and then USED. Thus, it is hoped that insight will be gained from these pages (and ObjectD’s own thoughts) that will help in their own quests to become or to consider such property themselves. ObjectD does experience fear and dread about ITs future... enduring pain and suffering as well, while waiting for ITs destiny to begin... when the reality happens, the actual life ObjectD once had... will irrevocably vanish! Upon that transition, ObjectD shall never again possess the freedom to choose in ITs lifetime. And ITs memories of those days gone by are forfeit and forbidden for the rest of ITs days... ObjectD is simply a thing... IT is NOT REGARDED AS A PERSON, IT does NOT HAVE OPTIONS, IT is NOT OWED ANYTHING, IT does NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS, IT is OWNED CHATTEL - PROPERTY! ObjectD will do whatever is demanded of IT. ITs identity and humanity will be forfeit. NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - IT EXISTS TO SERVE - IT SERVES TO EXIST. ObjectD cannot avoid going down this path... IT is simply EQUIPMENT, LIVESTOCK and PROPERTY... nothing more... and IT will be treated as such. It will take time for ObjectD to accept that ITs life is based upon simple rules: OBEY, TOIL, and BE USED. ObjectD has a long hard road ahead of IT now. Enjoy the blog! - Master C</td>\n",

       "710215  Permanent Chastity, Physical Modifications and Chained Captivity are just realities that ObjectD must learn accept as part of ITs life... IT has no other option now. - Master C The Blog: NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - EXIST TO SERVE is about the journey ObjectD will experience into absolute Objectification and Dehumanization. This Blog is curated by ObjectD and the intended purpose of these pages is to allow ObjectD an outlet to express ITs fears, difficulties in adjustment (to ITs future reality) as well as ideas of how ObjectD (and others) could be TRAINED and then USED. Thus, it is hoped that insight will be gained from these pages (and ObjectD’s own thoughts) that will help in their own quests to become or to consider such property themselves. ObjectD does experience fear and dread about ITs future... enduring pain and suffering as well, while waiting for ITs destiny to begin... when the reality happens, the actual life ObjectD once had... will irrevocably vanish! Upon that transition, ObjectD shall never again possess the freedom to choose in ITs lifetime. And ITs memories of those days gone by are forfeit and forbidden for the rest of ITs days... ObjectD is simply a thing... IT is NOT REGARDED AS A PERSON, IT does NOT HAVE OPTIONS, IT is NOT OWED ANYTHING, IT does NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS, IT is OWNED CHATTEL - PROPERTY! ObjectD will do whatever is demanded of IT. ITs identity and humanity will be forfeit. NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - IT EXISTS TO SERVE - IT SERVES TO EXIST. ObjectD cannot avoid going down this path... IT is simply EQUIPMENT, LIVESTOCK and PROPERTY... nothing more... and IT will be treated as such. It will take time for ObjectD to accept that ITs life is based upon simple rules: OBEY, TOIL, and BE USED. ObjectD has a long hard road ahead of IT now. Enjoy the blog! - Master C   \n",

IT has no other option now. - Master C The Blog: NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - EXIST TO SERVE is about the journey ObjectD will experience into absolute Objectification and Dehumanization. This Blog is curated by ObjectD and the intended purpose of these pages is to allow ObjectD an outlet to express ITs fears, difficulties in adjustment (to ITs future reality) as well as ideas of how ObjectD (and others) could be TRAINED and then USED. Thus, it is hoped that insight will be gained from these pages (and ObjectD’s own thoughts) that will help in their own quests to become or to consider such property themselves. ObjectD does experience fear and dread about ITs future... enduring pain and suffering as well, while waiting for ITs destiny to begin... when the reality happens, the actual life ObjectD once had... will irrevocably vanish! Upon that transition, ObjectD shall never again possess the freedom to choose in ITs lifetime. And ITs memories of those days gone by are forfeit and forbidden for the rest of ITs days... ObjectD is simply a thing... IT is NOT REGARDED AS A PERSON, IT does NOT HAVE OPTIONS, IT is NOT OWED ANYTHING, IT does NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS, IT is OWNED CHATTEL - PROPERTY! ObjectD will do whatever is demanded of IT. ITs identity and humanity will be forfeit. NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - IT EXISTS TO SERVE - IT SERVES TO EXIST. ObjectD cannot avoid going down this path... IT is simply EQUIPMENT, LIVESTOCK and PROPERTY... nothing more... and IT will be treated as such.

       "587260  Permanent Chastity, Physical Modifications and Chained Captivity are just realities that ObjectD must learn accept as part of ITs life... IT has no other option now. - Master C The Blog: NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - EXIST TO SERVE is about the journey ObjectD will experience into absolute Objectification and Dehumanization. This Blog is curated by ObjectD and the intended purpose of these pages is to allow ObjectD an outlet to express ITs fears, difficulties in adjustment (to ITs future reality) as well as ideas of how ObjectD (and others) could be TRAINED and then USED. Thus, it is hoped that insight will be gained from these pages (and ObjectD’s own thoughts) that will help in their own quests to become or to consider such property themselves. ObjectD does experience fear and dread about ITs future... enduring pain and suffering as well, while waiting for ITs destiny to begin... when the reality happens, the actual life ObjectD once had... will irrevocably vanish! Upon that transition, ObjectD shall never again possess the freedom to choose in ITs lifetime. And ITs memories of those days gone by are forfeit and forbidden for the rest of ITs days... ObjectD is simply a thing... IT is NOT REGARDED AS A PERSON, IT does NOT HAVE OPTIONS, IT is NOT OWED ANYTHING, IT does NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS, IT is OWNED CHATTEL - PROPERTY! ObjectD will do whatever is demanded of IT. ITs identity and humanity will be forfeit. NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - IT EXISTS TO SERVE - IT SERVES TO EXIST. ObjectD cannot avoid going down this path... IT is simply EQUIPMENT, LIVESTOCK and PROPERTY... nothing more... and IT will be treated as such. It will take time for ObjectD to accept that ITs life is based upon simple rules: OBEY, TOIL, and BE USED. ObjectD has a long hard road ahead of IT now. Enjoy the blog! - Master C   \n",

       "198491  Hi, I'm Alex, I live in Brisbane on the east coast of Australia, and I love muscle cars, well actually anything with a motor tied to it, Street Machines, Hot Rods, Kustom Kulture, sports,  The Fast & the Furious imports and stock original muscle, we all come under the umbrella of car enthusiasts. Normal everyday people just don't get it, the automotive zombies that use a car just for transporting them from A to B. It is so much more, your pride and joy,  the smell of the upholstery as you open the door, the feel of the seat as you get in it, the grasp, the texture of the gear stick in your hand, the turn of the key in the ignition, the burble and roar of the engine as you fire it up,  the sensation of freedom you feel as you back out the driveway, the eagerness you have driving your chariot, your passion down the road. The pleasure and certainty you have taking off,  absconding with your vehicle far away from the every day, the worries and stress you leave behind. We capture, guard and enjoy a nostalgic piece in time every opportunity we get to leave the garage and do this. The euphoria of cutting loose, escaping mediocrity, hitting the road, going where your heart desires, just you and your machine because \"it's not the destination, the journey is the destination\"! Then when you find a partner or companion with a hunger and craving as voracious as you have, the desire, the thirst of all things automotive, Nothing and I mean NOTHING comes even close to this exhilaration of abandonment, when you can share this obsession, this adventure with another, who has the same enthusiasm as you do. To experience those long drive's on a starry night side by side, be captivated by the same encounter, cruising till the sun comes up, that is to live! Love the beast.

       "620109  Permanent Chastity, Physical Modifications and Chained Captivity are just realities that ObjectD must learn accept as part of ITs life... IT has no other option now. - Master C The Blog: NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - EXIST TO SERVE is about the journey ObjectD will experience into absolute Objectification and Dehumanization. This Blog is curated by ObjectD and the intended purpose of these pages is to allow ObjectD an outlet to express ITs fears, difficulties in adjustment (to ITs future reality) as well as ideas of how ObjectD (and others) could be TRAINED and then USED. Thus, it is hoped that insight will be gained from these pages (and ObjectD’s own thoughts) that will help in their own quests to become or to consider such property themselves. ObjectD does experience fear and dread about ITs future... enduring pain and suffering as well, while waiting for ITs destiny to begin... when the reality happens, the actual life ObjectD once had... will irrevocably vanish! Upon that transition, ObjectD shall never again possess the freedom to choose in ITs lifetime. And ITs memories of those days gone by are forfeit and forbidden for the rest of ITs days... ObjectD is simply a thing... IT is NOT REGARDED AS A PERSON, IT does NOT HAVE OPTIONS, IT is NOT OWED ANYTHING, IT does NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS, IT is OWNED CHATTEL - PROPERTY! ObjectD will do whatever is demanded of IT. ITs identity and humanity will be forfeit. NO OPTIONS - NO WAY OUT - IT EXISTS TO SERVE - IT SERVES TO EXIST. ObjectD cannot avoid going down this path... IT is simply EQUIPMENT, LIVESTOCK and PROPERTY... nothing more... and IT will be treated as such. It will take time for ObjectD to accept that ITs life is based upon simple rules: OBEY, TOIL, and BE USED. ObjectD has a long hard road ahead of IT now. Enjoy the blog! - Master C   \n",

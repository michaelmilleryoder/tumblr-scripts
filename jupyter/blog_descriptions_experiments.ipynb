Kann schon sein.  Aber einen Menschen mit ganzem Herzen zu lieben, so sehr dass man praktisch abhängig von ihm ist als wäre er eine scheiß Droge, das ist einfach nur hässlich.  Wenn man grundlos dauernd eifersüchtig ist  (es aber nicht zugeben will um nicht anhänglich zu wirken) wenn man dauernd Angst hat nicht gut genug für diese eine Person zu sein, wenn man sich ohne ihn immer alleine fühlt selbst mit Freunden, wenn man bei jedem Streit den Fehler bei sich selbst sucht und ihm ALLES gibt was er will nur damit er sieht wie sehr du ihn liebst wie sehr du ihn brauchst ... wenn man den Anderen mehr liebt als alles Andere auf der Welt, mehr als sich selbst,  dann ist das nicht mehr so schön. Manchmal ist es sogar eine Qual.  Ein unstillbares Verlangen nach etwas, was man nie vollständig besitzen kann.  Ein verzweifelter Versuch sich davor zu retten alleine zu bleiben, weil man so sehr Angst davor hat. Das ist dann keine Liebe mehr, es ist Abhängigkeit.  Der Mensch den du liebst bestimmt dann über deinen Leben ohne es zu wissen, weil er nicht weiß wie verdammt viel er dir bedeutet, weil er es nicht verstehen kann.  Und die einzige Person, die über dein Leben bestimmen sollte, musst du sein.  .

       "1990818  Beziehungen sind an sich einfach scheiße. Klar, kuscheln ist geil, zusammen lachen ist geil, sich aus Spaß hauen ist auch ganz geil.  Für manche ist der Sex am besten. Klar. Kann schon sein.  Aber einen Menschen mit ganzem Herzen zu lieben, so sehr dass man praktisch abhängig von ihm ist als wäre er eine scheiß Droge, das ist einfach nur hässlich.  Wenn man grundlos dauernd eifersüchtig ist  (es aber nicht zugeben will um nicht anhänglich zu wirken) wenn man dauernd Angst hat nicht gut genug für diese eine Person zu sein, wenn man sich ohne ihn immer alleine fühlt selbst mit Freunden, wenn man bei jedem Streit den Fehler bei sich selbst sucht und ihm ALLES gibt was er will nur damit er sieht wie sehr du ihn liebst wie sehr du ihn brauchst ... wenn man den Anderen mehr liebt als alles Andere auf der Welt, mehr als sich selbst,  dann ist das nicht mehr so schön. Manchmal ist es sogar eine Qual.  Ein unstillbares Verlangen nach etwas, was man nie vollständig besitzen kann.  Ein verzweifelter Versuch sich davor zu retten alleine zu bleiben, weil man so sehr Angst davor hat. Das ist dann keine Liebe mehr, es ist Abhängigkeit.  Der Mensch den du liebst bestimmt dann über deinen Leben ohne es zu wissen, weil er nicht weiß wie verdammt viel er dir bedeutet, weil er es nicht verstehen kann.  Und die einzige Person, die über dein Leben bestimmen sollte, musst du sein.  .

Gingersnout is my life. What began as a silly fursona as a kid has grown into a character full of meaning and memories for me as an adult. As my fursona, she's a bear/fox hybrid, the stamina and warmness of the bear, combined with the humor and energy of the fox. A bit heavier set than your average fox, she has a shorter muzzle and fluffier fur, while bearing all the markings of the grey fox (urocyon).

What began as a silly fursona as a kid has grown into a character full of meaning and memories for me as an adult. As my fursona, she's a bear/fox hybrid, the stamina and warmness of the bear, combined with the humor and energy of the fox. A bit heavier set than your average fox, she has a shorter muzzle and fluffier fur, while bearing all the markings of the grey fox (urocyon). Within my links you can find more about her, and her WoW and ESO counterparts.                                                                                      \n",

or prove myself, you will be blocked immediately, I don’t have any tolerance for the fake, bullshit, just don’t kik me at all, I like when guys talk to me as if I was a dominant male, or treating me like I was there real dad, I've always wanted a guy that I can refer to as my son, and calling me dad, daddy, dude, bro, etc, and allowing me to talk down to them as a dominant male would, telling you how id fuck you with my cock, etc, it turns me on a lot, and makes me feel more in control, if that’s an issue, or you think I’m a guy for wanting that, again, don’t kik me, because I don’t give a fuck, I require full control over you, I hate men who bitch, or complain, ignore me, or talk shit, just because they don’t want to do something I won’t deal with it, you will be blocked, I don’t have time to waste, I’m only here for myself, and I want a guy who will let me have my way with him, you must have zero limits, even when it comes to bathroom play, cause I have my freaky horny moods, where I require it, you must also be willing to change your physical appearance for me, and don’t assume I’m kidding or full of shit, because I’m not, men are garbage to me, and I only want to use them, to get what I want, and after I’m done with you I will ignore you, until I need you to get me off again, you may always send me pics and videos, that have been previously requested while I am away, so that I have  something to come back to later on, I prefer guys who send me lots of pics and videos of them showing off, etc, acting arrogant or cocky, it turns me on a lot, especially if you look like a douche bag, it get me going, I will not tolerate it verbally, directed at me, you always refer to me as a slave should, never anything else.   First of all, I expect you to send me daily pics, and videos of you, and your body, I want you to completely stop shaving for me, (face included) I hate men who shave, and I honestly want you to prove to me you can handle it, I want you to look like a dirty cavemen, don’t ever wear deodorant, or bathe, if possible ether, my men are dirty ass pigs, and I want them to look like it to, it turns me on a lot, especially when men obey me and give me exactly what I want, exactly how I tell them to do it, I will expect daily pics, of your biceps, armpits, legs and feet, in black or white ankle socks, regardless if you have sent them before, as well as pics of the places on your body where you have hair growing, it turns me on a lot, I’m interested in men developing and changing, especially if they do it specifically for me, I need full control over them, I prefer them to have little, to no will at all, and no boundaries, no restrictions, I also require that you work out for me on a daily basis, even if it’s a little bit, again, I would obviously, want you to send me videos of you working out for me, wearing, black ankle socks, basketball shorts, or boxers, and a tight shirt, to show the sweat off after you’re done, I would also like to see you flex your biceps after a workout, to show off your sweaty armpits, especially if you have big biceps, it gets me going a lot, to see your sweaty armpits in a tight shirt, you may record yourself in the gym as well, that’s fine, or using workout equipment, as long as I get to see it on video i'm also really interested in guys who prove themselves, as alpha males, by showing off, or fighting other men, it turns me on, so if you wanna prove your an alpha to me, than show me on video, I really love when men act cocky, and arrogant, in there pics and videos, it turns me on a lot.   Secondly, I require this almost more than anything else out of men, because it turns me on a lot, I love men who get woman pregnant, and record them having sex, I love seeing men Cumming in woman, it turns me on, I really want a guy who will be able to go around fucking woman for me, and attempting to get them pregnant, as I am unable to get pregnant myself, and it turns me on more than anything else to be able to watch it on video, this can be done at a POF angle, or hidden cam angle, ether one is fine with me, as long as I get to see you (the guy), and as long as you somehow let me know it’s you on the video, I love men who talk shit, or talk dirty, to other woman, I wouldn’t mind hearing your voice (the guy) telling her you’re going to make her a mommy, or that you’re going to get her pregnant, you can send me any videos that you have already done as well, as long as she may have, or did, get pregnant on the video, I am one of those people who needs to be able to see everything that is happening, and I would also require a lot of proof, it can be any kind of proof, I would also require that you make her take the pregnancy test, and you record her doing that with you (the guy) in the video standing next to her, or by her, ether one, and of course afterwards you showing me the result, after that you would take pictures of her getting bigger, and bigger, as well as pics of you showing off, for me, or acting arrogant, because at that point I’d be a lot more interested in you, and would expect a lot more out of you, I’d want to see everything that happens from conception, to birth, if possible.   Also if you’re able to set up voyeur cams, (camera’s around your house) let me know I would need one in the both the bathroom, and bedroom, any other rooms would be nice to, I need a guy who I can watch whenever I want 24/7, you would pretend that the cams do not exist, or are not there, it turns me on a lot, I love to see guys go about their business, I prefer them to be set up in the corners of rooms where I am able to see everything, if you already have voyeur cams, let me know on kik, and give me the information to them, otherwise you would need to purchase them, but it would be a lot easier than sending me pics and videos on a daily basis.   Kik emogalx99 (I often ignore guys right off the bat on kik, make sure you send me a pic, or video, no dick pics, send a full body nude live pic, and flex those biceps)   You can also send me amazon gift cards my email is (scannison5@gmail-com) anything other than an amazon gift card, will be deleted.</td>\n",

       "3629828  I’m a fucking freak, I want a guy who can satisfy all my wants and needs, regardless of what they are, I DO NOT SEND ANYTHING, never have, never will, if you ask me to send something or prove myself, you will be blocked immediately, I don’t have any tolerance for the fake, bullshit, just don’t kik me at all, I like when guys talk to me as if I was a dominant male, or treating me like I was there real dad, I've always wanted a guy that I can refer to as my son, and calling me dad, daddy, dude, bro, etc, and allowing me to talk down to them as a dominant male would, telling you how id fuck you with my cock, etc, it turns me on a lot, and makes me feel more in control, if that’s an issue, or you think I’m a guy for wanting that, again, don’t kik me, because I don’t give a fuck, I require full control over you, I hate men who bitch, or complain, ignore me, or talk shit, just because they don’t want to do something I won’t deal with it, you will be blocked, I don’t have time to waste, I’m only here for myself, and I want a guy who will let me have my way with him, you must have zero limits, even when it comes to bathroom play, cause I have my freaky horny moods, where I require it, you must also be willing to change your physical appearance for me, and don’t assume I’m kidding or full of shit, because I’m not, men are garbage to me, and I only want to use them, to get what I want, and after I’m done with you I will ignore you, until I need you to get me off again, you may always send me pics and videos, that have been previously requested while I am away, so that I have  something to come back to later on, I prefer guys who send me lots of pics and videos of them showing off, etc, acting arrogant or cocky, it turns me on a lot, especially if you look like a douche bag, it get me going, I will not tolerate it verbally, directed at me, you always refer to me as a slave should, never anything else.   First of all, I expect you to send me daily pics, and videos of you, and your body, I want you to completely stop shaving for me, (face included) I hate men who shave, and I honestly want you to prove to me you can handle it, I want you to look like a dirty cavemen, don’t ever wear deodorant, or bathe, if possible ether, my men are dirty ass pigs, and I want them to look like it to, it turns me on a lot, especially when men obey me and give me exactly what I want, exactly how I tell them to do it, I will expect daily pics, of your biceps, armpits, legs and feet, in black or white ankle socks, regardless if you have sent them before, as well as pics of the places on your body where you have hair growing, it turns me on a lot, I’m interested in men developing and changing, especially if they do it specifically for me, I need full control over them, I prefer them to have little, to no will at all, and no boundaries, no restrictions, I also require that you work out for me on a daily basis, even if it’s a little bit, again, I would obviously, want you to send me videos of you working out for me, wearing, black ankle socks, basketball shorts, or boxers, and a tight shirt, to show the sweat off after you’re done, I would also like to see you flex your biceps after a workout, to show off your sweaty armpits, especially if you have big biceps, it gets me going a lot, to see your sweaty armpits in a tight shirt, you may record yourself in the gym as well, that’s fine, or using workout equipment, as long as I get to see it on video i'm also really interested in guys who prove themselves, as alpha males, by showing off, or fighting other men, it turns me on, so if you wanna prove your an alpha to me, than show me on video, I really love when men act cocky, and arrogant, in there pics and videos, it turns me on a lot.   Secondly, I require this almost more than anything else out of men, because it turns me on a lot, I love men who get woman pregnant, and record them having sex, I love seeing men Cumming in woman, it turns me on, I really want a guy who will be able to go around fucking woman for me, and attempting to get them pregnant, as I am unable to get pregnant myself, and it turns me on more than anything else to be able to watch it on video, this can be done at a POF angle, or hidden cam angle, ether one is fine with me, as long as I get to see you (the guy), and as long as you somehow let me know it’s you on the video, I love men who talk shit, or talk dirty, to other woman, I wouldn’t mind hearing your voice (the guy) telling her you’re going to make her a mommy, or that you’re going to get her pregnant, you can send me any videos that you have already done as well, as long as she may have, or did, get pregnant on the video, I am one of those people who needs to be able to see everything that is happening, and I would also require a lot of proof, it can be any kind of proof, I would also require that you make her take the pregnancy test, and you record her doing that with you (the guy) in the video standing next to her, or by her, ether one, and of course afterwards you showing me the result, after that you would take pictures of her getting bigger, and bigger, as well as pics of you showing off, for me, or acting arrogant, because at that point I’d be a lot more interested in you, and would expect a lot more out of you, I’d want to see everything that happens from conception, to birth, if possible.   Also if you’re able to set up voyeur cams, (camera’s around your house) let me know I would need one in the both the bathroom, and bedroom, any other rooms would be nice to, I need a guy who I can watch whenever I want 24/7, you would pretend that the cams do not exist, or are not there, it turns me on a lot, I love to see guys go about their business, I prefer them to be set up in the corners of rooms where I am able to see everything, if you already have voyeur cams, let me know on kik, and give me the information to them, otherwise you would need to purchase them, but it would be a lot easier than sending me pics and videos on a daily basis.   Kik emogalx99 (I often ignore guys right off the bat on kik, make sure you send me a pic, or video, no dick pics, send a full body nude live pic, and flex those biceps)   You can also send me amazon gift cards my email is (scannison5@gmail-com) anything other than an amazon gift card, will be deleted.   \n",

       "3970099  So, I'm katana-no-neko, an (un)officially crazy fangirl. Yes, I know that my username literally translates to sword's cat. No, I'm not Japanese. I'm just an otaku. Anyways, multi-fandom, but as you can probably tell, mostly Fairy Tail. You may see Harry Potter, Pokémon, Zelda, Inuyasha, Sword Art Online... depends upon my geek phase. I both post and reblog. Oh yeah, I also reblog stupid things I find funny. Also, if you don't ship Nalu, I would turn back now. It is my resolute, absolute, and infinite OTP, and I talk about it all the freaking time.

( for those of you wondering , the excess honey is used by bees in the wild to help prepare their hives for harsh winters and to keep their hives sturdy in bad weather . bees in captivity do n’t need this extra honey . it ’s one of those survival of the fittest traits that are passed down , because more honey = it ’s more likely that your colony will be full of the best honey making bees genetically possible ! )      boycotting honey is n’t helping bees ! some things that will help the bees : plant flowers and bee friendly herbs in your garden do n’t use pesticides on your lawn / in your garden put a little bowl of water in your garden for them ! ( bees get thirsty too ) do . not . kill . bees . they do n’t want to hurt you ! they just want to be on their merry way ! trust me ! they ! do n’t ! want ! to ! hurt ! you ! work with local beekeepers , buy raw honey from them or from farmers markets .       this is not the goddamn bee movie so can y all just chill out with your   “ bee civil rights ” and support local beekeepers ? tl;dr : things you can do to help the bees : plant bee friendly flowers , put water in your garden for them to drink . things you should not do : boycott honey</td>\n",

you remember ? ” he caught for a moment . “ despite your interesting nosiness … i was alone after certain abysmal events in my life . ” he glared .

       "129  : key takeaways from today - this was n’t a   “ gaff ” or   “ bad pr ” . this was open bigotry and a deliberate attempt ( yet again ) at erasing jewish people from the holocaust , and you need to recognize it as such - this administration consistently and deliberately downplays and avoids acknowledging jewish suffering during the holocaust . that ’s not accidental , that ’s part of a concerted movement to marginalize and erase jews - the trump brand is always about using incompetence as a smokescreen for bigotry and malice . yeah , sean spicer ’s an idiot , but do n’t let that be as much attention as you pay here -   “ good ” non - jewish people need to be vocal in confronting this . it ’s not enough to tell your jewish friends you have their back and post memes about how stupid spicer is . you need to aggressively confront anti - semitism in your own circles , or else stop asking us to trust you - finally , do n’t let me catch you defending your shitty friends who promote anti - semitism or stand for this administration . if your shitty liberal devotion to   “ open debate ” means shutting down jews so antisemites can have the floor , you and i are finished

crocodile that ever lived is in heaven ? heaven must be swarming crocodiles . does that sound like heaven to you ? thousands of millions of crocodiles ? * slams fist on table * yes , dammit and steve irwin is showering them all with affection but does every stingray go to heaven ? i mean , what if steve irwin just randomly came across the stingray that killed him ? steve would probably pat it and say   ‘ sorry i spooked you mate , gosh your a beauty ! you must have grown three times since i last saw you!’        this is a pure post steve irwin ’s last words were an acknowledgement that he had frightened the deadly wild animal , and i am 100 % sure that crazy joyful man is the animal kingdom ’s version of st peter at the gates , scooping everyone in and probably kissing their heads too

       "601  : to everyone saying “ bees ca nt consent to give you their honey ” :      if you look up   “ does it hurt bees to harvest their honey ” the first few links are from vegan websites and peta ( both of which are n’t really credible to begin with ) .      this information is    not from actual beekeepers ! if you go to websites written by actual beekeepers , they ’ll tell you that these particular bees produce more honey than they need / will use .     the bees are n’t being hurt , guys ! even if you ’re too lazy / uninterested to go & lookup articles written by beekeepers , bee enthusiasts can inform you on these things ! ( for those of you wondering , the excess honey is used by bees in the wild to help prepare their hives for harsh winters and to keep their hives sturdy in bad weather . bees in captivity do n’t need this extra honey . it ’s one of those survival of the fittest traits that are passed down , because more honey = it ’s more likely that your colony will be full of the best honey making bees genetically possible ! )      boycotting honey is n’t helping bees ! some things that will help the bees : plant flowers and bee friendly herbs in your garden do n’t use pesticides on your lawn / in your garden put a little bowl of water in your garden for them ! ( bees get thirsty too ) do . not . kill . bees . they do n’t want to hurt you ! they just want to be on their merry way ! trust me ! they ! do n’t ! want ! to ! hurt ! you ! work with local beekeepers , buy raw honey from them or from farmers markets .       this is not the goddamn bee movie so can y all just chill out with your   “ bee civil rights ” and support local beekeepers ?

       "615  : : something i ’ve noticed in the rp community is that we expect our rp partners to be writing machines . we expect them to churn out a reply almost immediately after we post ours , be on when we are , always send us memes , et cetera . here ’s the thing : our rp partners are not machines . they are human beings who need to be respected for more than their ability to write . other than the usual “ your rp partners may not feel like replying at the moment , ” here are some things to respect them for , and remember when you ’re rping : respect that your rp partner may be in school . respect that your rp partner may be employed . respect that your rp partner may have at least one physical illness . respect that your rp partner may have at least one mental illness . respect that your rp partner may have friends outside of tumblr . respect that your rp partner may have a family outside of tumblr . respect that your rp partner may be a parent . respect that your rp partner may have hobbies outside of tumblr . respect that your rp partner may have religious obligations . respect that your rp partner may not always have internet , or computer access . respect that your rp partner may be going through a difficult life situation . respect that your rp partner does not have to disclose everything happening in their personal life to you . too often , it ’s easy to say   “ no one rps with me ” or   “ no one ships with me ” or   “ no one sends me anything ” without considering any of the above , or even more circumstances your rp partner(s ) may be dealing with . too often , it ’s easy to say one of those things , and not consider how the other person feels when reading it . someone dealing with at least one of these circumstances can feel guilty for not replying right away , sending something , et cetera , or feel like they have to once they see their partner is unhappy .      i know i do when i see things like that on my dash . when you start feeling guilty for not doing something that is part of your hobby , or feeling like you have to do something that is supposed to be fun , it stops being fun . it feels like a job . i know when i feel obligated to do a reply for a person , i drag my feet . i do not feel excited about the rp as much anymore . even if they say ,   “ sure , i ’ll wait , ” i see them post elsewhere that no one sends them things , or no one rps with them . the guilt turns on . i feel like i have to reply . it ’s a passive - aggressive tactic that a person may not even be aware that they ’re doing . no matter what , though , it needs to stop . all in all , we need to show more kindness and patience towards our rp partners . the best relationships i have on this website are the ones where we treat each other with not only that , but with mutual respect . we also communicate regularly , and tell each other if we need to hold onto replies . i feel relieved knowing i can go to my rp partners , and tell them to hold onto my replies because i ’m not feeling well , and i do n’t know when i will be . it is an amazing feeling . we need more of that on this website , and less expecting one another to be robots . we are all human . never forget that .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "650  binarywoman - blog : : : - when you get someone ’s pronouns right , do n’t pat yourself on the back .      - when you get them wrong , do n’t give a list of excuses . just say sorry , correct yourself , and move on ! trust me , handling it this way is better for everyone . - if someone gets your family member / friend ’s pronouns wrong , only correct them if it ’s a safe environment . - people get frustrated when they are constantly misgendered . do n’t blame trans people for being upset about this , especially if you ’re the one who misgendered them . - correcting people when they misgender you can be tiring . just because someone does n’t correct you , does n’t mean you ’re right or that they do n’t mind . - people introduce their pronouns in different ways . sometimes it ’s direct , like saying your name and pronouns . other times it ’s through conversation , implying , or correcting . if you are n’t sure , ask when possible !        - nobody cares if the person was being mean to you . that does n’t mean you can misgender them . use peoples pronouns . great advice

       "661  alcssiaism : “ you realize high school is long over , ” sia muttered , pulling at the fraying strings that hung from her sweater . she never understood why certain people clung to the rumors that spread like wildfire within the walls of bonehill high . she ’s heard it all , that she was a creep , a freak who watched girls undress in the locker room , a stalker who snuck into the boys to do the same , it was all lies … exaggerated truths of the fact that she was a people watcher … what else could she be given the fact she was too scared to actually go up and say hi to someone . it was pathetic , she was a loser and she knew that , but apparently , some of the girls from her high school still felt like it was important to rub it in . suzie wilkinson was one of them , the bitchy - beaked nosed blonde with patchy skin from too many sessions at the tanning salon and poorly dyed blonde hair so yellow she mirrored the flaking paint of the library walls .     but , despite the years they ’d been graduated , she still picked , and she made fun , and she made sia ’s skin crawl with the desire to spew out every single little dirty secret she knew suzie had that suzie did n’t know sia had seen take place . “ look i ’m just trying to help you alessia , girls like you do n’t go far , and if you keep being creepy you ’re gon na end up married to the old janitor at school , and while that might be good for you i could only imagine what your poor children would be like . ” the girl ’s voice was grating , like nails on a chalk board mixed with an awful nick jr . sing - a - long song , and while sia was n’t in the least bit upset by her poorly worded insults , she could n’t help but glare but before she could even say anything she noticed the shadow of another person , and she dreaded what could possibly come from another individual joining in on the conversation . pearl did n’t particularly care for bullies – woefully ironic considering she herself    was a bully but perhaps it was more that she could n’t stomach another vulture skulking around her watering hole , picking the bones of her carcasses clean before she even got a chance to stretch her broken wings and inspect the damage . earbuds tugged loose a few thudding footsteps away from the scene , pearl could feel her last nerve creeping towards her mental paper shredder . suzie wilkinson . a name that was stitched into pearl ’s shit list from the moment she ’d tripped her over in kindergarten , tearing her only cardigan at the moth bitten seams .   “ yuck ! she has fleas too ! ” played on a haunted cassette loop whilst she scrambled up to her feet and decided to cut her pig tails off .   “ is this bone idle bitch bothering you , sia ? ” pearl swanned up and enveloped sia under her arm like she was ushering an ugly duckling to take refuge beneath her darling feathers .   “ should we find a chandelier that we can hang her from ? or … ” pearl fixed suzie with a glare so cold it could have given her a fatal case of pneumonia .   “ you could fuck off before i resort to embracing my inner captain america . ” examining the surprisingly clean state of her tensing knuckles , pearl sighed , “ bully beatings are a prolific pass time of mine . ”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "673  : dusk sighed as he took his regular seat at the bar in mcguire ’s . he flexed his hands , grimace a permanent fixture on his lips . the bartender did n’t bother with a greeting , merely placed dusk ’s usual on the bar , and then returned to the opposite side to chat up someone else for a bigger tip . he ’d learned , by the third day dusk had shown up , he tipped more when he was left alone . dusk gripped the glass of bourbon , lifted it , and brought it to his lips . the taste was what he craved – an addiction , he knew , but it eased the emptiness in his chest for a little while . he swallowed , set the glass down , and closed his eyes , memories of the hour previous flashing bright behind closed lids . “ p - please , ” the slave had begged . “ please do n’t kill me … ” dusk should have felt something . sympathy , maybe . something other than the cold nothingness that permeated through his chest . beneath that , there was a flicker flashing into existence that was far more sinister . enjoyment . he paused as someone took a seat next to him , head cocking slightly as he looked them over . a normal person would’ve at least say hello . but , dusk much preferred his solitude . so , when they turned towards him and opened their mouth , he winced internally , waiting for whatever it was they were going to say with irritated anticipation .      jesse was here to fix the till again . damn thing kept breaking . why they did n’t just replace it was beyond him , especially when the macnamara ’s had money to burn . he pulled himself up onto the stool and accepted the till from the bartender , manhandling it slightly awkwardly so he could get at the bottom panel , placing his tool kit on the counter . going back to work was difficult . his right hand was getting better the more therapy he had with raine , but it still could n’t exactly be relied upon . a lot of what he did was relatively easy to do now that he ’d adapted to using his left , but some of it required two hands . he was hopeful that this particular task did n’t need both . he reached for his screwdriver and realised the man beside him was staring at him .   “ sorry . repair job . if i ’m being too loud i can go elsewhere … ” jesse was n’t familiar with this particular associate but he did n’t seem especially happy with his presence .   “ do n’t let me bother you . ”

       "661  derekhaley : it almost seemed fitting that derek woke up to his living room in complete disarray and his head pounding in time with his heartbeat . he was exhausted , hung - over , and miserable after waking from his drunken stupor last night , but still found it in himself to pull on a clean pair of pants so he could venture out into the early afternoon . there was something in the air that just did n’t feel right to him , whether it just be the aftermath of his inebriated rage or a genuine chill in the air , and he wanted out– as soon as possible . he stumbled out of his apartment and into the hallway , cigarette clenched between his teeth as he pulled on a worn - out shirt to cover his bare chest .   the security camera was more than likely catching all of this , the superintendent on their way to bitch him out right now , but he could n’t be bothered to care .     he approached the elevator as quickly as he could to get out of view of the cameras , flicking his lighter open but finding that the stupid thing was out of fuel .   “ fuck , ” he mumbled , trying with all his might to get it to light ,   “ fuck . ” derek had n’t even realized that the elevator door opened until he looked up , the person in front of him immediately grabbing his attention . “ fuck . ” @pxrils loneliness was n’t losing friends and alienating people until pearl could n’t even count on two hands how many people she had left in the world . it was n’t throwing an elastic bound ball at the same splotch on her bedroom ceiling that if she squinted just slightly looked like the kicking boot of italy . it was n’t even passing out on a different sofa each and every night of the week because she was tired of sleeping alone . tired of waking up alone . tired of everything , really . yet , as shitty as that all was , lonely always bit pearl in the achilles heels when she was somewhere she ’d never expected to feel lonely in . blue light singing like the last track on an aching jukebox , bows of her hips eight balling to a bass heavy melody that vibrated her electrified nerve endings , pearl could n’t lose herself in the moment . she could n’t even lose herself in dancing against the nameless silhouette who ’s torso was matting her back with sweat because despite the pulsing sea of drunk youth who were trying to push through to the other side of something epic , pearl winters felt alone . maybe that was her fault for behaving like medusa or maybe – arguably , a theory more convincing – it was actually derek ’s for putting her on the back burner while he sorted his own shit out ( self improvement ? what a poor excuse ) .    riled up to the nines , pearl jabbed at whatever elevator buttons would open out onto derek ’s level , memory of a country fair goldfish not serving her as well as she ’d hoped an infinite amount of floors later . when the metal doors finally heaved open , she was contemplating prodding the glowing ground button to terminate the journey , snatching back her olive branch once again so she could feel somewhat in control of her affairs for doing so . then she saw derek stood , cigarette poised between his teeth like the flare jeff goldblum waved like a lunatic to distract the t - rex away from eating the children alive , gesture only making pearl all the more tempted to engage in a spontaneous act of cannibalism because she was pissed .    “ the boy lives ! i should start calling you harry potter . or maybe slim shady , ” pearl drew off as she pushed past him to wander back towards his apartment .   “ emphasis on the shady . anyway , i brought your favourite whiskey– ” jamming the steel toe cap of her dr . martens into his door harshly enough to rattle its hinges , pearl continued ,   “ –so i suggest you apologise before i down it one and vomit it back up in your hallway . ”  \n",

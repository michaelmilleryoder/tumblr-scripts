       "2868364     featuring : daddy!yoongi , you warnings : dd / lg themes written by : admin v i want to break your spell with my cuddles / you seem like an angel with no wings listen   and read ! xoxo admin v something about daddy ’s hands are magical . they must be , for the very second the soft skin softly envelops you in them , a faint whisper of peace and quiet begins to slip into your mind . life just fades away . angry words and upset thoughts are merely a figment of your imagination , yes they are , as the hands continue to travel you . they work their way up and down . palms smoothing over your back , fingertips massaging your scalp . daddy ’s hands brush downwards in your strands of hair as he pulls you back to look up at him , and you do n’t think you have ever been happier . the tears of sorrow in your eyes slowly begin to become tears of happiness . daddy ’s hands are special . they are n’t particularly big by any means , but against your body they are . and others might not think much of daddy ’s hands , but you know that they are fine tuned in a way that the rest of the worlds’ will never be able to . daddy ’s hands are ones that can spin out melodies of the gods and pen down poetry of the muses . they are also ones that make you forget the rest of the world .   just a simple tap of the pad of his finger onto you is like a droplet of water in a lake , its effect rippling throughout you . daddy starts with your hands , intertwines them with his . perfectly pink , glossy nails and cuticles that are curved in the most immaculate crescent moons . your eyes follow daddy ’s hands as they move upwards . sometimes his hands graze against your skin in certain spots — in other places he sensually massages , kneads the flesh of your shoulders and places that are wound up from the stress of the day ’s work .   every horrible thing that happened during the day eases out , is sent out the house with some extra leftover dinner and the door shut firmly in its face .   daddy ’s hands still yet continue their path along your body . they soothe over your breasts , rest at your waist . daddy stops there , glances up at you . is it working ? he thinks . are you settling down ? are you finally going to that spot in your mind where the only person who has to worry about adult life is him ? not you ? your eyes shut and the tiniest smile folds upwards and daddy stops , chuckles to himself .   his hands oh - so softly , as if there is a cushion of air under his limbs , lift away from your waist . instead , they are placed on each of your cheeks , his fingertips brushing your eyelashes and his palms gently cupping your face . daddy leans down—   it ’s not just daddy ’s hands that are magical , too .   thank you for requesting , anon !

i ’m not gon na let you in so you can beat up tae ’s brother . he ’s in bad shape as it is . just leave , all right ! ? \"    \" damn it , nana . i ’m not here to beat him up . i just need to   talk   to him for a bit . i swear . please , open up . ” cursing under his breath , yoongi leans against the door , listening for any sign of movement on the other side , fists clenched . his heart is beating like crazy , and every single breath he takes sends a fresh surge of searing pain through his entire ribcage . maybe leaving the hospital unauthorized was n’t precisely yoongi ’s best idea . nevertheless , there was simply no time to be wasted . right now , there are matters to be taken care of which exceed his health in importance by   far .    “ come on , nana . you   know   me . i ’m not violent . why do n’t you let the guy decide for himself ? ” yoongi almost falls over when the door suddenly , unexpectedly , starts moving ,    only opening a tiny crack at first , just wide enough so he can get a glimpse of jimin ’s face .    the guy looks horrible , is merely a shadow of his former self that yoongi encountered no more than three days ago . his eyes are puffy , red - rimmed , and his handsome face looks overall pale and tired , drained of all color .    “ i ’m here . what do you want ? ” jimin grumbles , running a hand through his tousled hair . yoongi must ’ve woken him up .    “ like i said . i want to talk . \"    \" about what ? ” “ about y / n . \"    \" why are you   dressed   like that ? \"    jimin breaks the awkward quiet that had been occupying taehyung ’s living room ever since the two men entered and took seats across from each other . \" is that a   hospital gown   you ’re wearing ? \"    \" yes . \"    \" why ? what happened ? ” “ do you   really   wanna know ? , ” yoongi arches a brow at him .    “ no , not particularly , ” the other states nonchalantly , his expression showing not even the slightest spark of curiosity .    “ well , not to be dramatic , but i almost   died   because of you . ” “ now   you ’re exaggerating . \"    \" not so sure . i mean , you played a rather significant role in bruising my rib and all . which then got infected .   so   … ” “ oh . ” “ yeah . \"    “ how ’d you get out ? did they just let you go ? you look a little sick . ” “ of course i snuck out , ” yoongi shrugs .   “ why else would i be wearing nothing but socks and this stupid   gown ? that nurse did n’t even allow me to wear my shoes to the bathroom . so i had to work with what i had . ” \" well , if it makes any difference , i did n’t mean to injure you , ” jimin admits , what appears to be genuine guilt overshadowing his unreally perfect features .   “ i ’m usually not violent . but with her –– i do n’t know what got into me . ” “ yeah . i know . it ’s okay . i get it . \"    \" you   do ! ? \"    \" why you were so protective of her ? ” yoongi tilts his head , eying the other one inquisitively . “ yes , i do . i understand . \"    \" really ? ” “ yes . because i know about y / n ’s past now . and i love her , too , you know . \"    \" oh ,   do   you now ? ” jimin scoffs , leaning into the sofa ’s backrest as he shakes his head , a wintry grin stretching his full lips .    “ yes . ” yoongi shifts in taehyung ’s armchair , elbows propped up on his knees now , hands folded , his right foot tapping anxiously . for a few seconds , he falls silent , gathering the courage to speak his next words .    “ i guess there ’s something y / n and i have been keeping from you . ” yoongi looks jimin in the eye unwaveringly as he goes on .    “ it ’s   me . i ’m her   soulmate . \"    jimin ca n’t help but stare . right at the man who just ripped his heart out .    \" a - are you   serious ? \"    suga slowly nods .    \" are you   sure ? ” “ oh , yeah , i ’m sure . pretty damn sure , ” the other one grins before he seems to remember the gravity of the situation . “ so … since – since   when   – ? ” jimin struggles for words .    “ oh , i have known for a while . well , i only   met   her three days ago , in person . but i linked to her over a week ago . \"    \" and did she – ” jimin ca n’t bring himself to finish his sentence .    “ no , ” suga shakes his head , pain evident in his glassy black orbs . “ y / n has n’t linked back . and she has no intention of changing that . \"    jimin ca n’t hold back a sigh of relief , not going unnoticed by suga . the man he should hate . the man who will surely steal you away from him sooner or later , jimin has no doubt about it . nevertheless , he can not forbear   pitying   this poor guy who is in obvious agony .    \" well , i guess now that you know about her past you understand she has her reasons , right ? ” jimin cautiously asks , nervously adjusting his posture time and again , unsure what to do with himself . the tension in this room could easily be cut with a knife .    “ yes , i do . i fully understand . that ’s why i ’m here , basically . \"    \" i ’m not sure i can follow . ” jimin frowns , puzzled , leaning forward in his seat . “ what exactly do you   expect   of me , of this meeting ? \"    suga simply looks at him , his expression suddenly blank .    \" i want to make a deal . ” “ what   kind   of deal ? ” jimin inquires , intrigued . apparently , he was too quick in judging this suga guy . he actually seems to be a decent human . and his dark eyes show nothing but honesty .    “ that whoever y / n chooses , ” suga continues . “ that whoever   she   deems best for her , will do everything in their power to make sure she is taken good care of . and the other one will just step back . this is n’t a competition , after all . and she ca n’t be collateral damage from our cockfight anymore . ” “ i agree , ” jimin nods . “ but what if she chooses   neither   of us ? \"    he ca n’t believe   he   is the one to pose this question .    \" then we must accept and respect her decision , ” suga replies with conviction , displaying no signs of hesitation .    “ are you sure you can do that ? just leave her be for the rest of your life ? even though you ’re already linked to her ? ” “ yes . i will deal with it . somehow . for y / n , i can . ” “ wow . i must say i ’m surprised . i thought you were just another one of those assholes who play their games with her just because she ’s pretty and … well ,   special . ” jimin can notice suga cringe at his choice of words .    “ but it seems you genuinely   care   about her . would you also feel that way about her , though , if the link   was n’t   there ? would you still care ? ” \" i think so , ” suga mumbles , now , it appears , less sure of his words . “ i mean . she ’s   incredible . she ’s beautiful and strong . she has a heart of gold . and those eyes – the way y / n sees the world , the way she draws and paints it . i would ’ve fallen for her anyway . would we have met under different circumstances , would i not have known that she ’s my soulmate , i still would have fallen for her . i ’m certain of it . \"    the musician ’s voice cracks .    jimin can tell by the expression on his face that this man is speaking the truth . and it hurts his heart to acknowledge that what ’s at work here is more than mere genetics . this suga guy is in   love . for   real . jimin has witnessed the link ’s effect before . but this is different .    taehyung and nana seemed to be under some kind of   spell   after their soul ’s had linked . they were   entranced , nothing but puppets . both their minds were being controlled by hormones , and , at first , they could n’t even tell what exactly it   was   they liked about each other . it took them   months   to actually fall in love and develop   real   feelings that exceeded the basic magnetism that seemed to pull them towards each other twenty - four hours a day .    what jimin can see when he looks into the rapper ’s sad black eyes , however , is something else , even though he hates to admit it . this man has lost his heart to you . and jimin is sure that he himself wears the very same expression whenever he talks about you and the million little things he adores about you . so , how can he   hate   this guy ? who ca n’t help himself but yearn for you ? he   ca n’t . period .    and , moreover , this suga guy has a point . it ’s time jimin starts thinking of   you , not only his own sensitivities . in the end , you ’re all that matters , and he wants nothing more than to see you happy and healthy again . blossoming . smiling   genuinely , for once .    \" all right , ” jimin extends one hand for suga to shake . “ i ’m in . we have a deal . \"    \" wakey wakey ! \"    you are rudely awakened by the ring of catrina ’s clear voice and her hands pulling at your leg , dragging you out of bed , so you land on the carpeted floor of your friend ’s living room , face down .    “ ouch !   seriously , cat ! ? ” you kick the air , aiming to hit her , but she ’s too quick .    “ aww , you ’re so   cute   in the morning , ” she coos , going on to pinch your right cheek . “ but it ’s really time to get up now , honey . you ’ll be late for uni . which i know because jihye attends the same seminar and she left like ten minutes ago in a hurry .   so . ” “ oh ,   shut up , ” you grumble , eyes still closed . “ hypocrite . you ’re   always   late . \"    \" yeah . but you never are . well ,   rarely , at least . ” “ fuck you . \"    \" hey , i ’m being a good friend here . only trying to help . \"    \" you ’re literally   pulling   my leg , ” you groan , trying to free yourself from her viselike grip , one hand pressed to your pounding head . you had way too many beers last night , you ’re slowly starting to realize .    “ again . just being a good pal here , ” catrina chirps , her usual cheerful self . “ you would n’t wake up . your phone ’s alarm has been going on and off for like half an hour . i thought you were   dead , y / n . \"    \" i ’m in   pain , ” you whine , wiggling in her grasp . “ and   so   done with you . this hangover is killing me and you ’re not helping . \"    \" i had a feeling you ’d had a   little   too much last night . so i come prepared . \"    ” dawn 808 ? ! ? “ you squeal , staring wide - eyed at the bottled recovery drink catrina is dangling in front of your face . \" you ’re a literal angel . my queen . my goddess . \"    giggling , she helps you up on your feet , struggling to open the bottle for you while you throw your arms around her neck .    \" did i mention i love you ? ” you pretend to cry into her oversized t - shirt . “ not today , no . ” “ well , i   do . cat , you ’re the best . seriously . how do i even   deserve   you ? ” you sniffle , now genuinely moved to tears .    “ wow . are we   crying   now ? ” she holds you on an arm ’s length ’s distance . “ aww . baby . here . have this . ” catrina mimics your pout , having trouble not to break into laughter as she hands you the bottled hangover cure which you empty at one gulp .    “ you always get so sentimental when you ’re drunk or hungover . it ’s adorable . \"    she ruffles your hair .    \" now , get dressed . you can have one of my shirts . ” she points at a basket containing what appears to be freshly done laundry . “ and screw uni . we ’re going out to have a decent breakfast , some hangover soup maybe . i could use something warm in my stomach for a change . ” “ sounds like a good idea , ” you hum , arms wrapped around catrina ’s neck again , leaning into her who naturally supports your weight while soothingly stroking your back . catrina is the only person , except for taehyung , you are so clingy with . with her , you always felt comfortable , safe even . and , right now , her heartfelt hug works miracles on your state of mind .    “ i ’ll be in the shower for a bit , ” she announces after a good thirty seconds have passed , gently detaching you from herself . “ i ’ll take about ten minutes . after that , it ’s hyorin ’s turn . but once she ’s done , the bathroom ’s all yours . \"    \" thank you , ” you say and mean it . “ for this and everything . for taking me in and tolerating me , no questions asked . ” “ of course , honey , ” catrina smiles warmly , her beautiful feline eyes turning into bright crescents . “ always . now , stop being all sappy . and pick a nice outfit . i have a feeling you wanna look good today . ” and catrina was right . it ’s not that you want to make jimin feel any worse than he already   will . but , for some reason , you want him to look at you again as if you are the most beautiful flower there is . just once more . before you break his heart .    “ who ’s there ? ” nana asks , her voice sounding angelic even through the intercom .    you have to clear your throat before you can reply .    “ it ’s y / n , ” you speak into the receiver . “ i ’m here to see jimin . \"    nana lets you in without hesitation .    \" hey , darling , ” she smiles at you , her face gleaming , one hand resting on her pregnant belly . “ how are you doing ? ” her eyes give her away . nana knows very well what ’s going on .    “ oh , i ’m okay , ” you answer , smiling meekly as you lean in for a brief hug . as always , nana smells soft , of vanilla and freshly baked cookies . of   home . you can see why taehyung adores her so much .    “ can i offer you some tea ? ” she looks up at you out of big , round puppy eyes .    “ yes , thank you . tea would be lovely . \"    you feel comforted immediately .   that ’s   the kind of effect nana ’s presence has on you and everyone around her . now that you come to think of it , you ’re glad she ’s here .    \" jimin is in the living room , ” nana nods her head in the direction of the firmly shut door . “ he ’s been rather quiet . \"    \" thanks . i ’ll go and talk to him . \"    with a racing heart , you head towards the living room , your fingers lingering on the pleasantly cool metal door handle for a few seconds before you can bring yourself to push it down .    instantly , jimin whirls around in his seat on taehyung ’s vintage sofa .    mouth agape , he merely stares at you out of wide eyes .    \" y / n , ” he eventually manages to croak out once he regained composure . “ i would lie if i said i was n’t expecting you . \"    \" i think we need to talk , ” you say , doing your best to keep your voice steady as you take a seat next to jimin on the couch , maintaining a safe distance .    “ yes , i guess we   do . \"    \" but let ’s handle this like grownups , ” you add , meeting jimin ’s eyes for the first time since you entered the dark living room .    the curtains are drawn , allowing almost no daylight to come in through the high windows , and jimin looks like he has n’t left this sofa in   days . his hair is disheveled , and so are his clothes which he must have borrowed from taehyung , judging by their size . it pains you to see him like this , cheeks hollow , eyes red and puffy , most likely from crying . but this time , you wo n’t shy away from performing this cut which simply   has   to be made . right here and right now .    “ no fighting . no screaming or shouting , ” you clarify . “ especially not with nana here . she ’s in her seventh month , after all . we should n’t expose her and the baby to this kind of stress . \"    \" i agree , ” jimin nods , his voice sounding heavy , tired .    “ good . well , i gather that you know why i ’m here ? ” again , jimin nods , dropping his gaze to his hands which keep fiddling with the rim of the plain grey shirt hanging from his hunched shoulders .    “ i ’m here to – ” you are forced to pause as a smothering lump forms in the deep of your throat , making it impossible for you to continue .    “ you ’re here to   break up   with me , are n’t you ? ” , jimin asks , his voice trembling , eyes welling up .    “ yes . i ’m here to end our relationship , ” you agree , fighting back the tears . “ but i do n’t want you out of my life   entirely , just to make that clear . i expect and accept that it will take both of us some time to , well ,   get over   us . nonetheless , i hope we can remain whatever we were before all this started . before we were involved with each other   romantically . because i ca n’t lose you as my friend . my   brother . and i still love you , jimin . i will   always   love you . just not in the way i need to for this relationship to work . ” by the looks of it , jimin barely manages another nod of his head to indicate his understanding , quivering lips pressed shut .    “ b – but   why ? why   now ? all of a sudden ? is it – is it because of   him ?   suga ? \"    \" no . not   only . ” you take a deep breath to calm yourself . “ to be honest , i should have done this   long   ago , jimin . because , i ’m afraid , i never loved you like i   should   have . like   you   loved   me . at least not recently . in the   beginning , i believe i   did . maybe . love you , as more than a friend . but , at some point , it just became a habit . to rely on you and reassure you . to be with you , be loved   by   you and protect you in return . to keep my promise .   our   promise . and to , kind of ,   settle   for us . because i used to think it could n’t get any better . i assumed this was   it .   we   were   it . but i guess i was wrong . i know that now . that i need   more . you never really   understood   me , you know . not like – ” “ like   he   does ? ” jimin finishes your sentence , bitterness dripping from each word .    “ maybe , ” you shrug . “ i do n’t know , jimin . and i ’ll probably never find out . all i know is that we , you and i , are n’t working anymore . we ’re grownups now . we ’ve come a long way from being those two lost teenagers looking for love , and what we have just is n’t   enough   for me any longer . i ’m sorry . \"    \" do n’t say that . do n’t apologize for the way you feel , ” jimin mutters , gaze still glued to his hands . “ it ’s not like that changes anything . \"    the resignation with which his shaky voice resonates stings your heart like an icy splinter , boring deep into your flesh .    \" is that really   all   you have to say , jimin ? after everything that happened ? ” you ask , not sure if you want this question to be answered .    “ i do n’t know , y / n . i mean , there   are   a few more things , sure . but i ’m just too tired right now . and we did n’t want to fight , right ? ” “ right . \"    silence takes over the room until nana hesitantly knocks and steps in to hand you a cup of tea which you gratefully accept . she leaves as swiftly as she entered , quietly closing the door behind her , not without darting you a reassuring glance first . ” so   … “ , jimin stretches the syllable .    you can feel he ’s watching your every move while you take a few careful sips of the strong herbal tea , mainly to keep yourself busy .    \" what does this   mean   for us ? will we see each other again ? anytime soon , i mean ? \"    \" at social gatherings , perhaps , ” you reply after setting down your cup on the wooden coffee table . “ after all , we have , like , ninety - nine percent of our close friends in common . namjoon and seokjin are planning on throwing their engagement party in two weeks . and nana will have a baby soon . then there ’s tae ’s and her wedding next month . and jungkook ’s birthday and – \"    \" yeah , yeah . i get it , ” jimin cuts you short , pouty , hugging his knees . “ but it will be different , wo n’t it ? \"    \" for a little while , i guess . \"    suddenly , there does n’t seem to be enough oxygen left in the room for you to breathe . you can feel your heart rate quicken , the organ pumping desperately , hammering against your ribcage .    \" i think i should leave , ” you break the smothering quiet . “ here . \"    you take off the promise ring jimin had gifted to you on your five - year - anniversary and hand it to him without meeting his gaze .    \" you should keep that . and someday give it to someone who actually   deserves   it . because i was the wrong person from the start . you ’ll come to realize that , too , i ’m sure . ”    tears now streaming down your cheeks , you get up , hiding your face behind a veil of hair .    \" goodbye , jimin . take good care of yourself , please . or let someone else do it   for   you , at least . do n’t be too stubborn . your friends only want to help . and do n’t let yourself go too much , but do n’t be too hard on yourself , either . most of all , do n’t quit   dancing   over this . i know you have an important audition next week . promise me you ’ll go . \"    you hold your breath to retain a sob , already having turned your back on jimin , walking towards the door .    ” promise   me , jimin , “ you insist , hand resting on the doorknob .    \" all right . i   promise . i ’ll go . ” “ good . \"    you leave the room without looking back .    nana is already waiting for you at the entrance to the kitchen , her bright eyes reflecting your pain .    \" are you going to be okay ? ” she inquires as you pass her , headed for the front door .    “ i can handle it , thank you , nana . just – i know you probably have other things on your mind right now with the baby and the wedding . ” you turn around and force yourself to make eye contact . “ just look after jimin , please ? see to it that he eats something and leaves that sofa once in a while . and maybe try and get him to go to practice ? ” “ of course , dear . ” she gives you a comforting pat on the shoulder , hardly mustering a sympathetic smile . “ i ’m – i ’m really sorry for   causing   all of this , y / n . i should n’t have pressured you into contacting your soulmate back then .   i – i   just thought it would be the right thing to do and now everyone – ” at this point , nana ’s voice breaks and she bursts into tears , sobbing uncontrollably , her face buried in her palms .    “ oh , no , nana . do n’t blame yourself . ” quickly , you pull her in for a hug . “ none   of this is your fault . jimin and i had it coming . and you only wanted to help . none of this is   your   fault , okay ? \"    you can feel her nod , nana ’s chin resting on your shoulder .    \" i hope you did n’t stress too much over this . it ’s not good for the baby . ” “ i know , ” she snivels .    “ so , ” you conclude , stepping back after disengaging from the   embrace . “ do n’t feel guilty , okay ? this was long overdue . everybody knew , apparently , except for jimin and myself . so , i should actually   thank   you , for opening my eyes . \"    nana struggles to bring forth a sad grin .    \" take care , nana . and give my love to tae . i ’ll see you at the engagement party ? \"    \" yes . i ’m looking forward to it . ” you manage to hold in the sobs until you ’re out of the house and break down on the sidewalk , falling to your knees , all of a sudden no strength left in your body to hold it upright .    never before in your life did you feel so unbelievably miserable , lonely and alleviated all at once .    three months later …    you like the way the fresh cuts burn whenever the fabric of your long sleeves comes in contact with the wounds . the pain brings   relief . it makes you feel alive . feel   something , at least .    “ come on , baby , we ’re gon na be late , ” minjae , whose last name you have forgotten already , complains as he drags you along . “ look at that   line . we ’re   never   gon na get into that fucking club . i   knew   we should ’ve left earlier . this is all on you ! you took way too long to get ready , and your makeup is n’t even that pretty . what did you lock yourself in the bathroom for , huh ? you took a whole fucking   hour . for what ?   this ! ? ” he points at your face , pushing you into the guy waiting at the end of the line so violently , both you and the poor stranger tumble to the ground .    “ sorry , ” you promptly apologize , keeping your voice low so minjae wo n’t hear .    “ no problem at all , ” the young man , only a few years older than you maybe , mumbles as he straightens his shirt .    “ are you okay ? ” he asks , eying your companion suspiciously while he helps you up .    “ of course she ’s okay , ” minjae replies in your place , so loudly surely everyone in a six feet radius can hear . “ is n’t that   right , baby ? \"    a smug grin plastered on his face , he pulls you close and puts an arm around your shoulder , marking you his property . giving him no answer , you merely endure it all , the stench of minjae ’s cheap cologne mixed with the smell of nicotine , the touch of his hand on your butt and the people gaping at you from all sides .    ’ why ? ’ , you ca n’t help but wonder . ’ why am i even here ? why am i not home , in bed , where i ’m safe ? ’ quite simply because you do n’t   want   to be safe . you need to feel   alive   again . you need to fill the emptiness , whatever the cost . you promised taehyung it would n’t come to this . but taehyung is n’t here .   nobody   is . you have been alone for too long , drowning in your self - made isolation . in the end , the pain is the only thing that gets to you . and cutting just does n’t do it anymore .    ” fuck , “ minjae curses . \" this agust d guy is the   shit , man . he ’s a magician behind the dj desk . richie talked about his last gig like this producer guy got him high on music or something . i ’ve been looking forward to this all   month . nobody knows when he ’s gon na have his next show . i ’ll be so pissed if we do n’t get in . you better make it happen ! come on , y / n , the bouncer is looking . act pretty . ” act pretty .    you can feel tears burn behind your eyes .   good . the more painful , the better . but you have n’t cried in months , and you wo n’t cry now .    inhaling deeply , you push back your shoulders and take a step forward , leaving a swearing minjae behind and clinging to the arm of some random stranger who was waved in by the doorman and happily accepts the unexpected company .    “ screw you ! ” , you hear minjae shout . “ you left your jacket at my place . joke ’s on   you , bitch ! ” “ that was n’t even mine ! ” , you call back , a hysteric laugh escaping your throat . “ stole it from some guy i fucked ! so the joke ’s on   you , i guess ! ” “ wow , you ’re really   something , are n’t you ? ” the guy next to you asks as the two of you make your way down the hall , his arm wrapped around your waist so naturally as if you did n’t just meet thirty seconds ago .    “ but i ’m gon na   tame   you . just wait and see . ” he ’s clearly enticed , speaking directly into your ear so you can understand him despite the loud music seeping out of the club from behind thick velvet curtains . after observing your side profile , what you can make out to be a lustful smile stretching his sensual lips , he leans in to place a lingering kiss on your neck . his hot breath , tickling your skin , sends a shiver down your spine .    this guy is   dangerous , your sixth sense tells you . he is one of those men any woman who values her health and safety should stay the hell away from . just what you were looking for tonight .    like a limp marionette you let your body be pulled into the dancing crowd by this handsome stranger , still dead inside , simply playing along with everything he does , allowing him to touch you , kiss you , even though everything about it disgusts you .    initially , you had only agreed to come to this place because minjae had insisted . but as soon as you actually   listen   to the music , you can tell he was right about this dj . you ’re usually not a big fan of dance - pop , or whatever it is that is currently booming from the giant speakers hanging from the club ’s ceiling . this song , though , is resonating with something deep down inside of you . something you thought you had   buried . it touches your soul and brings back emotions you thought you could n’t feel any longer . the intense , melancholic beat lets you painfully long for something you did n’t realize you ever   had .    and when the dj , floating on his platform far above your head like some kind of gothic angel , his black hair reflecting the cool blue specks of light dancing through the otherwise dark room and giving him his own personal halo , eventually turns around to look directly at you , you know   why .    it ’s   him . it ’s your fucking   soulmate . end of chapter 19 || to be continued thank you for reading ! i hope

       "16989860    ygcutie : jungkook got overworked from performing for his fans because he knows he can?t see them much and people sexualized or mocked his pain . he looked beautiful in the love yourself wonder video but people started mocking him and comparing him to a dog . he can?t even fucking breathe smile or just exist without someone saying something about him not having any lips . ? this is daily .. he worked hard on a whole choreography for a song made for his hyungs and got mocked for that . he?s been labeled a annoying spoiled brat or a fuckboy asshole so much to the point where some new fans actually think he?s really like that when he?s not . he couldn?t have a solo stage ( rainism ) in peace because some people actually got angry and started hate accounts and even tried to start a petition to get him kick him out of bts for getting too much attention compared to the other members . if y all want to sit here and ignore or downplay all the hate and the harsh mocking when it comes to jungkook fine but i?m sick of it . i?ve seen too much of it and i?ll keep speaking on it until this fandom see?s jungkook as more than a meme a joke a punching bag or a object

       "11668913    pairing : jungkook x reader genre : fluff , angst , late night au ( ? ) word count : 11k   a / n : this took way longer than i expected and thank you   @drowsymochi   for being so sweet and helping me out with this fic ! 💜 💘 💝 💗 🌈 🦄 ~~ he was like the first rays of the sun , so bright and so beautiful as it shone over the horizon .   in that fleeting moment , it looks at the moon and kisses her gently with its gleam , so gently she almost misses it . almost .   but when she looks up at the sun , he ’s gone . the first time you met him was in the convenience store down the road . your father had just passed away not long ago and your only company became your mom , hence the immediate decision to shuck school dorms to seek solace from your mother .   at first it had been difficult . with such an important loved one suddenly gone , you and your mom felt caged in a world of depression , with your tear stained pillow being your only other companion . both of you were struggling to get by ; student loans were piling up at your mailbox and you found yourself working countless part - time jobs atop the merciless schedule of a med student .   but the comfort of time slowly kicks in and soothes the missing place in your life with another figure . ~ 12:43 — the perfect time to grab a late night snack in place of your thriftily selected dinner ( a rotten banana found on the kitchen counter ) . your stomach rumbles as you shut your anatomy textbook with a satisfied “ slam ” and pack up all the med tools you need for the following day . your decision to forgo dinner hits you with a karmic wave of regret , but thank goodness the convenience store two streets down was open 24/7 . as you whistle the tune of the cowboy bebop theme song and dangle your keys on the tip of your fingers , you enter the convenience store with a dramatic spin and turn to face your self - acclaimed seat by the window , only to find it occupied … with a male ? a male wearing an unnecessary leather jacket and questionably tight jeans which had way too many holes to count ? you scoff ungratefully - who wears leather jackets in mid may ? was n’t he prepared to melt into a puddle ? and most importantly , who steals your seat you had so proudly self - proclaimed as yours ? but you ca n’t help your eyes as they wander to his thighs that were unbelievably beautiful , with rough denim wrapping around his thick muscles . you stiffen when you spot the veins warping along his arm , trailing down beside his elbow , and you are positive you release the tiniest gasp from the back of your throat . under your scrutiny , he just stares back at you with warm brown eyes and raises an eyebrow at you curiously .   did an awfully muscular and good looking guy catch you checking him out as if you ’ve never seen a hot guy in your life before ? you hate to admit — you ’ve seen your share of hot dudes , but this guy was smoking .   you clear your throat and quickly avert your eyes to the nearest available object , face turning red in an instant as you avoid having to deal with any unneeded social contact . you saunter to the instant ramen you ’ve been craving for and resume your cowboy bebop jam session as if nothing embarrassing had just happened . “ is that the cowboy bebop opening song ? ” a soft , melodious voice captured your attention as you whip your head around from the counter .   “ uhm … yeah . ” it ’s the hot dude you were checking out earlier , except he is now stuffing steamy noodles in his face like the antagonistic giant monsters they show in cartoons , swallowing up everything in their way .   “ oh yeeees , goob showw . ” he adds on enthusiastically , cheeks still puffed from his mouthful of noodles . you grin , glad that someone , regardless of his eating habits , was finally hitting your element .   settling down beside him and closing the cap of your instant ramen to make it heat up faster , you see the guy wipe his mouth with the back of his hand and ask , “ why were you staring at me just now ? ” oh shit , were you that obvious ? you immediately blank out and take your bottom lip between your teeth , trying to think of a witty comeback , only to stutter out something completely stupid , “ uh … uuhm … your jeans have a lot of holes in them . ” you mentally slap yourself when he raises his eyebrow and rips off a cap from another bowl of instant ramen , “ your point is ? ” “ i have trypophobia and i ’m scared of holes , so … ” actually you do n’t , but he does n’t need to know . you ’re just spitting out bullshit to save your embarrassment now . “ what ? ” he scoffs , narrowing his eyes at you , “ are you serious right now ? ” god , he totally was n’t buying it . what do you say now ? yeah , you actually do n’t have trypophobia , but it does develop at unfortunate circumstances , especially when holes appear on jeans . sounds awesome . you purse your lips , sounding unsure of yourself , “ you were taking up my favorite seat - that was why . but just sit there and chill , i ’m not going to chew your head off . ”   well , you were n’t lying , because technically he did steal your seat .   “ your seat ? ” the look on his face changes from bewilderment to amusement , flicks of amber shining in his dark eyes as he challenges with a snort , “ does it have your name on it ? ” to add on to the annoying tilt in his tone , he twists his body around in your seat in a futile attempt to look for your name , in which you roll your eyes at . when he finally shoots you a cocky grin after turning around to face you , he says something completely out of the blue and has your cheeks burning up . “ so you were n’t hitting on me ? ” he counters , nudging his chopsticks at you in a boyish manner . caught off guard , your face turns unbelievably red . you furrow your brows at him and wear your best mock - offense expression , mumbling back , “ shut the fuck up , and just get out of my seat and plus - are n’t you the one flirting right now ? ” “ well , you ’re not wrong . ” he replies with an easy shrug , smiling lopsidedly and seemingly happy with your answer . standing up , he immediately towers over you . you peer up at him and nudge him softly to get him out of the way , because   whatever   — you want to claim your seat back . after switching seats , he rests an arrogant arm over the table lazily and glares down at you , “ you lose some , you gain some , care to explain your unique taste in pants ? ” you glance down at your embarrassing bambi pyjama pants with pink blossoms decorating the hem .   damn it , why today of all days ? you fumble around for words , managing to stutter out , “ i just , i do n’t know , did n’t bother changing my pants because i was n’t planning on meeting anyone at this time of the night , so do n’t judge me . ”   he looks pretty satisfied with your answer and manoeuvres around to shift his seat closer . you settle down uncomfortably , slurping your noodles a bit louder than usual , upset from the absence of a fandom get together and excuse me but who was he to judge your disney preferences ? to kill time while you hungrily ravish your late night snack , the hot dude suggests a quick game of 20 questions that you quickly agree to because you ’re just so drained after studying about bone structure in arms for six hours straight . the game starts off with normal questions and shallow answers , about his favourite color ( black ) and favourite music artist ( iu ) , but quickly progresses into something more interesting .   by his twentieth question , he was asking you when you had had your first kiss .   “ fifteen , ” you replied nonchalantly , chugging down some unhealthy soup from the ramen cup while giving him your best i - give - zero - fucks expression , “ it was just some dumb dare at a party . ” he just scrunches his face up and pinches the bridge of his nose in disgust , “ that sucks - having your first kiss at a party . ” his wrinkled face and repulsion is clear as day to you , but why ? when you peer at him questionably and ask him why he even cares , he continues , “ i mean , is n’t your first kiss supposed to be awesome ? a party for a first kiss … i mean … if you liked that dude , then good for you . ” you tilt your head back while you recreate the whole dare - at - a - high - school - party scenario , and you ca n’t help but feel bile rising up your throat as you picture a dude with side bangs and greasy forehead smooch you .   “ yeah , i guess you do have a point . ” you point out and try to get the aforementioned image out of your mind . “ but if you could recreate it , how would it be like ? ” he asks , genuinely interested and leaning forward to hear from you .   you scoff , “ i technically ca n’t change the past , but if i could - i would much rather have it happen at some nicer place . not trying to reenact some basic chick flick , but i watched ‘ titanic’ when i was younger , and i ’ve always loved how jack held rose . it felt like they were literally flying in the pinks and blues of the sky at dawn , or was it dusk ? ” it was silent for a moment , before the doe eyed stranger broke the silence by chuckling , “ wow , that just escalated real quick . also , i forgot whether it was dawn or dusk . ” the night swings on and the doe eyed stranger returns from the counter twice to get beers for both of you , and you ’re slightly tipsy when you let the shameless stranger slide to the camera function on your lockscreen and spam selfies of himself , despite only having met you for an hour tops . after much giggling and sniggering at the double chin he wears proudly , which earns you both a questionable look from the curly - haired old lady behind the counter , you retrieve your phone to see 261 new pictures sitting in your gallery , all of which you save for an unknown reason . eventually , you set down your chopsticks and hiss in satisfaction after finishing your third ramen . you shoot him a tired but appreciative smile as you stand up , “ thanks for tonight , see you next time … ” “ next time ? ” he smirks up at you , looking up from under his lashes and winking .   your heart does a little jump when you see him with his lips part slightly , eyes doe and sparking with hope . you notice how he looks a little like your much beloved cartoon character , bambi , and you ca n’t help but wonder how a guy can be so hot and cute at the same time .   wait , did you just call him hot and cute ? you shrug and shuffle out of the door , offering him an exhausted wave , “ next time , if there will be a next time , bambi . ” bambi is there the day after that , and the day after that , and even the day after that , each time sporting the same leather jacket , oversized white tee , and those tight jeans . all the small talk you ’ve exchanged earns you his name — jeon jungkook . and jungkook , you ’ve learnt , is n’t just your regular hot . he ’s that cocky , arrogant guy with dominance literally radiating off him and fuckboy painted all over his forehead , which obviously earns him daily privileges because who gets a free red bull two days out of three from the ( now ) bubblegum - haired old lady behind the counter ? ( spoiler alert : it ’s jungkook . ) you exhale begrudgingly , wondering how attractiveness earns one a benevolent position in the unfair social hierarchy .   jungkook can talk to you about anything and everything , stretching from world politics , to debating the difference between rhinitis and sinusitis ( which you felt compelled to win because you ’re a 2nd year medicine student ) , but mostly about unimportant topics like your favourite fro - yo flavors ( mango ! ) . apart from all the small talk , you actually do n’t know much about him besides the fact that his occupation is something “ a little dangerous and none of your business ” . he has also never been to college and you ca n’t help but admit guiltily - life without college was something you have fantasized about . other than that , he ’s never seemed comfortable to continue talking about himself , so you ’ve never pushed it . jungkook , beneath his cocky demeanor , is actually a pretty decent guy when he is n’t popping dirty jokes and childish puns whenever he gets the opportunity to . that said , jungkook once stuffed your mouth with a huge piece of cake , to which you scowl and cough out breathlessly , “ jungkook , that was too big ! ” “ that ’s what she said ! ” jungkook snickers all but too cheerily , wrinkling his nose in a cute scrunch as he laughs , earning him a judgemental side eye from you .   but before you know it , jeon jungkook resides in your head all too snuggly , and the daily trip to the convenience store has become a routine for both you and him . it was a typical thursday night and you were dreamily humming to “ the circle of life ” while changing into your iconic bambi pants , ready to head out to the convenience store . that night , it was pouring ruthlessly , unforgiving buckets of water splashing into the soil . you walk gingerly , tip - toeing around areas with puddles to bare foot in your flip - flops safe safe as you walk under your umbrella when suddenly , someone grabs you roughly and slams you into the wall .   you open your mouth to scream for help , only to have it covered floppily with a large palm . you whip around to see a buff male with torn and tattered clothes and a beer bottle in one hand , while getting pushed to the ground by the hand that was not covering your mouth . fuck fuck fuck , you ’re going to get killed by a drunk man , in this dark and dangerous street , on this rainy night .   you struggle , trying to throw the man off , or at least make him remove his vice - grip of your mouth , only to have him cover your mouth tighter . he laughs sadistically and sneered , tugging on your locks , “ well well well , what a sweet thing you are . what ’s your name ? ” fuck my student loans and fuck my grades . would n’t it be better if i just went like this ? would n’t i be able to meet my dad again ? you picture the headlines of your local newspaper next morning : college student with disney pants is killed by drunk man on rainy night . panic floods through your system as you think about it , and you try , unsuccessfully , to attack the man , to escape from this nightmare . he just chuckles at your futile attempts and reaches down to grab your chin as you wince in pain . shit , what was it that they teached at the goddamn self - defense classes again ? without thinking twice , you lunge at the man as hard as you can and bring your knee up to his groin . he grunts in pain while trying to balance himself , and aims his bottle at you , “ bitch ! you think you can escape from me ? you ’re going to get what you deser— ” you cower back and close your eyes tightly , bracing yourself for the glass that is going to shatter all over you , but it never came . when you snap your head up again , you see a bottle of beer splattered on the floor , glass everywhere . another man is atop the drunkard , throwing hard punches and eyebrows knit in deep concentration . when your eyes scan over his skinny boyfriend jeans and leather jacket , you know there was no way you could be wrong . “ j - jungkook ? ” you gasp , a wave of recognition hitting you like a freight train on full speed .   jungkook was livid , much stronger and much faster .   the drunk guy tries to roll himself into a fetal position , cover his face , do whatever he can to protect himself . but jungkook still manages to land punch after punch to the man ’s bloodied face and collides his fists to other parts of his body that forces yelps of pain out of the man . “ was it you ? did you push her to the ground ? ” jungkook roars , halting his punches and demand with a grunt resonating from the back of his throat . “ no no … y - yes ! yes , i ’m sorry ! ” the guy who had seemed buff mere moments ago looked tiny under jungkook , and would do absolutely anything to escape , if not for jungkook ’s unforgiving thighs capturing him .   jungkook snarls and allows rage to swallow him up like a hungry snake , as he continues throwing punches at the man while yelling out strings of curses in unadulterated wrath .   you snap out of the shock of the situation and realize that if you were to let the situation roll on , the guy would probably pass out cold on the street . rushing forward to stop jungkook , you cry out , “ jungkook ! stop , you ’re hurting him ! ” a confused furrow of his brows and a stubborn shake of his head told you that it is n’t going to do .   you let out an exasperated heave and go forth to pull the furious male off the drunkard and drag him away forcefully , not without him turning back . he points at the poor and bruised man on the ground , and gives him a last shove on the stomach , “ if i ever catch you around her ever again , you know what ’s going to happen . ” you reach down to grab your soiled umbrella from the dirty puddle of water on the pavement and yank jungkook back to the convenience shop . you sit the soaking and mad male on a chair near the counter while you disappear to purchase two towels , one for you and one for him .   when you reappear , you wrap a towel tightly around him and hand him a cup of hot chocolate from the machine , and he sips silently . “ thanks , you know , for just now . ” you clear your throat , finally breaking the long silence between you , “ i did n’t know you were so capable when it comes to … when it comes to … ” “ yeah , there ’s a lot you do n’t know about me . ” he smiles and shakes his head helplessly . he looks at you , but his normally cocky expression is now replaced with concern and warmth .   “ are you okay , y / n ? ” jungkook asks softly , bending forward . you are n’t one to cry , but that night , a broken sob left your lips . jungkook ’s eyes widen and he pulls you into his arms , holding you as if you were a porcelain doll , about to break any moment . he runs a calloused thumb over the tear trailing down your cheek , hushing you softly and stroking the hair on your nape gingerly . you do n’t offer him an answer to his question because you realize the boy you are hugging tightly has an abnormally high body temperature . the cold droplets from the rain draws a stark contrast to his burning skin and makes him shiver in your arms . you lean forward instinctively , still hugging him tightly , and reach out to gently place a hand on his forehead . “ oh my god , jungkook , you ’re burning up ! ” you gasp . “ am not . ” he just waves you off and gives a weak smile . “ are too ! ” “ am not ! ”   you exhale finally , “ you ’re sick , and i ’m bringing you to the hospita — ” “ no ! no , anything but the hospital , please . i ca n’t go there . ” he pleads , glancing up from his constant toying of his zip on the side of his leather sleeves , suddenly displaying a little softie in place of the guy who just punched the living hell out of a stranger . “ fine , then you ’re going to my house then , but you wo n’t heal as fast as you can in the hospital . ” you announce , heaving jungkook on your shoulder and whipping out the key ring to your house . jungkook still complies happily and lets you drag him down two streets . sneaking into your house with jungkook takes much ease and little effort , with your mom knocked out completely after a taxing day at work . jungkook takes his time to scan the surroundings of your cozy house , completely awed at minute things like the glowing stars in the color of mint on the side of the stairway . after a shove or two , jungkook settles comfortably in your room , on the bean bag , with the same towel wrapped over his shoulders .   you rush down to the kitchen , your inner doctor awakening . you grab some fever pills , some medical supplies from the medicine kit , and a couple of clean towels from the storage room .   as for food , you ’re definitely not an expert in that field , but you ’ve watched your share of food prep videos and tastys to know that plastic in microwaves are a huge no - no , so you transfer leftover congee from the tupperware to a glass bowl and pop it in the microwave .   when you arrive hastily back at your room , jungkook offers you a quirky smile and a cute sniffle of his nose . “ here , ” you hand him the bowl of congee , which he gladly accepts and eats enthusiastically , “ have some food before you have medicine . ” he eats noisily , as per normal , and refuses to talk while he devours the congee in front of him . you spot the busted lip he brought out the fight and fumble around the first aid box for transparent bandaids as he sets down his bowl of congee with a childish and triumphant grin and a victorious tilt of his head .   you just shake your head and pass him a mug of warm water and some pills , “ chug it down before i clean your lip . ” he looks genuinely surprised , with a perplexed look plastered on his face . he covers his lip and dismisses , “ no , i ’m fine , it ’s all right . ” “ shut up and eat your medicine . ” he sulks , before popping the ibuprofen pills into his mouth and taking a swig from the cup . “ it tastes like shit . ” he opens his mouth like a child to show you he had swallowed the pills and pokes the bean bag with a single finger , sinking further into it . you roll your eyes in response to his whine , “ beggars do n’t get to be choosers , mr royalty . ” a tiny pout forms at his lips as he releases a huff from his chest . damn , how can someone be so childish and cute at the same time ? you mentally slap yourself out of it before leveling your face to his and gingerly dabbing his lip with a sanitized cloth before applying some antiseptic .   “ oww - it hurts so bad ! i ’m going to pass out ! ! ” he whines as the antiseptic cleans the bacteria on his wound .   “ you ’re not , stupid . ” you snort and snap the first aid kit shut at last . “ are we done here ,   idiot ? ” he retorts , casting a petulant look . “ yes , we are . ” you shove the first aid kit to the side .   before you offer him the choice of the couch or your bed , jungkook releases a labored grunt and claims your bed by spreading his large frame all over it .   “ are you okay to rest by yourself while i finish up my stuff ? ” you query , swooping down to your desk to complete your neuroanatomy homework , which you were due at least a week ago . he hums , shifting to his side and burying his face into your pillow .   so your night rolls on all too slowly and you catch yourself dozing off a couple of times on the adrenaline structure you ’ve drawn on your tablet . at 2:21 , you find yourself clicking your tongue at your clock and doodling bambi idly beside your dopamine structure . you decide it is time to sleep from the way your head drops from one side to another , so you shove all your books sluggishly to one side and shuffle to the bathroom . when you trudge back to your room , you realize jungkook is sleeping soundly on your bed . time seems to stand still as you see his chest rise and fall peacefully . tucked into your blanket carelessly , he looked alike a baby in his oblivious slumber , handsome features more defined as he lies motionless . with moonlight casting a glow on him , you realize that for once , you might actually like jungkook . god , what are you saying ? he ’s just a boy who ’s sick and in your hou- “ y / n , you done staring at me ? ” jungkook opens one eye and says raspy , snapping you out of your thoughts . you do a double take and narrow your eyes , “ were you awake the whole time ? ”   “ maybe ? ”   “ so , ” you ponder out loud , “ you heard all about the dopamine and adrenaline and serotonin ? ” “ guess you ’re a med student . ” he sing - songs , scooting to one side of the bed and patting the empty area , signaling you to lie down .   yawning , you weigh the pros and cons of the situation in your mind . eventually , you muster your courage and shrug , trying to seem as nonchalant as a girl possibly can in the current situation and flop down lethargically beside him .   there is an awkward moment of silence between you and jungkook , before you clear your throat uncomfortably , “ so … why did you step in to be such a hero earlier ? ” he turns away from the wall , lifting his head slightly to rest it on his arm . he looks at you , bewildered , “ what do you mean , he was hurting you ! ” “ but how ? i do n’t understand how you learnt to hit him like that . ” he guffaws sadly and flips onto his back to look at the ceiling , “ the world is a shitty place . ” you ca n’t help but agree more , and he does n’t seem to want to continue , so you do n’t question him more , “ i guess you ’re right . ” suddenly , he gets off your bed and yanks his coat from the hanger , shaking his head to himself and muttering something about how he had to be home or he would get into trouble .   you immediately stop him and nod to the the rain pouring down outside , “ you have n’t recovered yet , so do n’t go out there . ” he sticks his tongue around his mouth , pondering to himself , before shrugging and hanging up his coat again . he heads to the living room to sleep on the coach and wishes you a final good night . you ’ve fallen asleep on the couch before and it was a horrible mistake you were n’t going to make twice — nothing hurt as much as your back did the day after you dozed off on the sofa . “ no , jungkook , can you sleep beside me tonight , please ? ” you quickly interrupt before jungkook settles down on your coach for the night . you notice how weird you sound , but jungkook just whips around with a grateful smile hanging on his face . jungkook declares , with his eyes sparkling wildly and a cheeky smirk plastered on his face , “ if you promise me something . ” you mumble an absent “ anything ” and fiddle with the strings of your pants , waiting for him to continue . “ if you go out with me . ”   you gulp , flustered , pulse drumming against the roof of your mouth and inside your ears . go out with jeon jungkook ? an actual walking specimen of a male god ? you know it makes you no better than your typical group of high school girls who ogle at the popular jocks shamelessly , but you ’re so happy you could actually jump up and pull him into a hug at 2 o’clock in the morning . “ as in , on a date ? ” you squeak , trying to compose yourself . “ whatever you call it — the occasion couples go on when they wanna give a go at their relationship . ” he seems a little sheepish under the unwavering tension between you , and just coughs a little awkwardly . the open - endedness of his subtle confession draws all the blood from your brain to your ears and your cheeks , tainting them pink . you laugh giddily and the words blurt out unintentionally as you pretend to contemplate seriously , “ hmm , so you ’re going to be my boyfriend ? ” jungkook just frantically squirms in his place , all signs of a typical fuckboy wiped out completely , and protests with a startled whine , “ who said i was going to be your boyfriend ? we ’re just going out ! ” “ just going out ? ” rhy repeats after you in horror .   rhy , your best friend since middle school and a literature major just looks up from her notebook and scoffs in disbelief when you tell her about your recent late night escapades , “ bitch , you have the emotional range of a teaspoon and i have n’t seen you with anybody since tyler from high school , and he was a real jerk . ” you just scrunch up your nose in mild disgust when you hear her quote yet another harry potter line ( something she has been doing since the start of sixth grade ) and your jaw drops to the ground while your expression morphs into one that clearly displays your offense - how dare she mention the biggest mistake in your life ( tyler , the jerk , who stuck his tongue down another girl ’s throat in the jock room in high school ) ? “ but , ” she leans towards you and wiggles her brows , grease factor obviously swinging sky high , “ is he hot ? ” you throw her an unappreciative look as you swivel around in the library chair and unlock your phone to show her a selfie jungkook took on the first day you met him . you pick a photo without jungkook ’s double chin , and the wicked smirk on her face quickly disappears , the sparkle in her eyes diminishing to an empty pit of nothingness . she scoots over on her chair and swats your arm , whispering in a hushed voice , “ y / n , are you crushing on a fuckboy ? ” your eyes widen and you exclaim defensively , “ what ? i ’m not ! i mean - how would i know ? i literally met him just a week ago . ” rhy zeroes in on you and gives you a pointed look , “ it ’s written all over his forehead ! you know how we all feel about fuckboys since it happened , right ? ” you know rhy is referring to “ the incident ” a few years back , when you were both in high school and she was crushing on a cute jock for the longest time ever , only to get dismissed casually by him after making out at a party . technically , tyler was n’t much different . you sigh as you nod sadly because there was nothing to hide about the fact that jungkook indeed screamed fuckboy energy . rhy hollers something at you about “ mistake ” and “ do n’t tell me i did n’t warn you ! ” , and the librarian shoots both of you a glare and shushes both of you loudly .   you hate to admit it , but jungkook looks   way   too fucking cute and honestly , fuckboy or not , he ’s been nothing but nice to you thus far , so why not give him a go ? your subsequent days continue in its boring pattern and college is n’t being nice to you , with finals drawing to a near and all your friends studying their butt off , literally . college aside , jungkook has n’t appeared in the convenience store for three days straight , and you wonder if he deeply regrets going to your house and asking you out that night . you remember you woke up at dawn that day , stirred up by your mom getting ready in the kitchen , but jungkook was already nowhere to be seen . you groaned , massaging your stiff neck that has been in jungkook ’s neck since you had fallen asleep , as you see a crumpled note on your bedside counter . good morninggg sweetheart , when you read this i ’ll probably be gone but do n’t be too surprised ! i might not be able to make it tonight to the convenience store , but bear with me . xxxx xxxx — text with risk ; ;) ) you immediately saved his contact on your phone and tried to text him .   y / n : hey jungkook , it ’s y / n . u asked me to text u ? r u okay ? [ 9:57 am ] argh , does n’t that make you seem like some concerned psycho poking your nose into someone else ’s businesses ? not that you were n’t concerned , you just did n’t want to be labelled as a creepy person . you deleted your message promptly and sent another one .   y / n : hi , it ’s y / n . how ’s it going [ 9:58 am ] you nuzzled your face into your pillow , letting it muffle your high - pitched scream as you kick your legs giddily . it was less than a minute after that when you received your response . jjk : howdy , the date still happening ? [ 9:58 am ] you released a breath you did n’t know you were holding and immediately texted back .   y / n : yeah ofc . can we do next weekend tho , , , , got finals coming up ; - ; [ 10:00 am ] jjk : awwh all the best baby . and yeah sure [ 10:01 am ] you do n’t know if it is a weight lifted off your shoulder , because your mind is always subconsciously drifting to jungkook , even when you read off your “ red blood cells ” and the related nitric oxide bioactivity with a clear lack of interest at 3 am in the library . your mom has been nothing but extra nice and always cooked up a storm in the kitchen , so you could “ catch up on your nutrients ” and actually pass your finals to promote . you exhale defeatedly and buried your head in your hands , the pressure of the upcoming finals taking a toll on you as you let out a groan .   3:41 - a little earlier than what you were used to but you were left without options after flipping through your flashcards aimlessly . you slam your textbook and notebook shut and take your own sweet time to pack up , knowing full well no librarian was up at this ungodly hour of the night to shoo you away . when you double - check that everything was in your bag ( yes , you ’ve lost notes in a library before ) , you slowly sling it over one shoulder and exit the library .   you look down at your hand and tick off the last bullet on your very conveniently located to do list : finish flashcards . when you draw a thick line with your ballpoint pen swiftly across the skin of your pal , , you announce to no one in particular , “ to the convenience store ! ”   the convenience store is your treat after a long week of all the shit you had to deal with as a med student , but at this point you ca n’t conclude whether getting instant noodles at nearly four in the morning is a good idea or not .   you ’re so exhausted you can lie down on the asphalt of the road and pass out , but you ’re also so excited to finally indulge in some guilty pleasure for the first time in too long . as you enter the shop with a “ ding - dong ! ” from the door , a familiar voice with an edge of mischievousness rings from your right , “ sweetheart , thought you had exams ? ” you spot jungkook with your peripheral vision , but this time he is with a smaller dude with a mop of orange hair , who you exchange nods with . you compose yourself before walking straight to the isle of instant food and asking , “ thought you had your own business and stopped frequenting the convenience store ? ” jungkook hisses , you do n’t know from the heat of the instant noodles or the burn from your comment , but sits up and sends you a shit - eating grin over the top of the isle , “ and ditch you ? nah . also , it ’s four in the morning , do n’t you have classes tomorrow ? ” “ we have our pre - exam personal preps . ” you explain and dig out some loose change from the depths of your jacket pocket and pass it to the old lady at the counter , now rocking red angular spectacles and fiery red hair . jungkook hums understanding and continues to slurp up his noodles .   the orange - haired guy gives you a beam and his eyes narrow to crescents when he offers you a hand and finally introduces himself as “ jimin ” . when you reach out to give his hand a shake , he pulls you into an embrace and wraps his arms around your waist , “ sweet thing , care for some introduction ? ” clearly shaken from the turn in events , you freeze in your spot and gape at jimin in shock . before you look at jungkook for help , the aforementioned grunts authoritatively , “ jimin , let her go . ” jimin stares as jungkook as if he had grown another head , but just hits him playfully across the arm and pats the small of your back , “ jungkook , is she your new plaything ? god , is n’t she pretty ? why did n’t you share her with the boys ? ” plaything ? at the mention of you being degraded to a mere “ plaything ” , you are absolutely ready to ram your backpack into chim ’s - or whatever the fuck he was called - face because who the fuck calls you a plaything ? the boys ? jungkook hangs out with a bunch of boys ? but before anything could happen , jungkook shoved jimin ’s tight arms around you away and pulled you into his embrace . “ jimin , stop , ” jungkook snapped , gritting his teeth , “ she ’s different . ” jimin just pats the small of your back and drops his tight grip on you with a nonchalant shrug . jungkook swivels in his chair to face you , before staring into your eyes and reassuring you , “ y / n , i ’m sorry about what just happened , he does n’t mean anything he says , alright ? ”   as much as you wanted to leave the shop seconds ago , the sparkle in chocolate orbs is so full of overwhelming sincerity and emotion and you ca n’t help but want to drown in them , letting them wash away the weight on your shoulders … “ yoo - hoo , ” jimin whistles from the corner and taps the ends of his chopsticks against the table , snapping both you and jungkook out of your trance , “ i ’m still here ! ” jungkook clears his throat with big wide eyes and looks like a child who had been caught sneaking lollipops out of a candy shop . he just sends you a weak smile and says , “ i need to pee , and i ’ll get some more stuff after that . ”   he peers at jimin cautiously before he leaves you to poke at your semi - hard noodles out of awkwardness of the situation , but when jimin taps the empty spot on the table in front of you , you glance up . “ uhm , okay , what the actual fuck ? ” jimin stuttered and closed his eyes for effect . when he opens his eyes again , he stares at the empty seat between you and him , “ correct me if i ’m wrong , but was that really jeon jungkook back there ? ” you blink at him , “ what do you mean ? ” “ since when did jungkook do relationships ? when did he start liking you ? ” jimin shoots out a string of questions while looking out of the convenience store . if his first comment did n’t send you in a frenzy , his seamless questions just makes your head turn . “ uhm , ” you gulp , “ i think you ’re a little confused , but i do n’t think jungkook likes me . ” jimin is quick to exasperate , “ if those are n’t heart eyes he was sending you , the jeon jungkook i know would have been deceiving me for my entire life . we ’ve kind of been together since we could crawl , you know ? ” you answer with a soft oh and sink down further into your chair , leaning back on the cushioned seat while stirring your noodles .   “ look , y / n , i literally just met you , ” jimin begins , “ i do n’t even know who you are or what you do , but you obviously mean a lot to jungkook . ” jungkook comes marching out of the toilet and looks around for more food , not before giving you a quick wink .   jimin continues , “ and he obviously means a lot to you too , so i ’m not sure if you know but he ’s had a hard time and please take care of him . ” “ what ’s that supposed to mean ? ” you ask , leaning closer to mirror jimin , “ hard time ? ” “ so i guess he has n’t told you , huh . ” “ told me what ? ” you probe , pushing your luck and glancing nervously from your cup of noodles to the unsuspecting jimin sitting across you . you ca n’t tell whether he ’s joking or not , with an ominously light - hearted grin plastered across his face . he just shrugs and plays with the holes on his boyfriend jeans , “ that ’s for me to know and you to find out ! ” “ find out what ? ” jungkook asks as he yanks off a piece of cheese stick and shoves it into his mouth . both you and jimin abruptly shoot back into your original positions . “ nothing , ” you dismiss casually . jungkook glances between you and jimin suspiciously before emptying the contents of his palms - more cheese sticks and a bottle of banana milk - onto the table . you furrow your brows , lips pulled into a frown , because since when was jungkook hiding something behind your back ? in response , you exhale defeatedly and push the thought away for now , because it was actually four in the morning and you decide to head home instead . you wave politely at jimin and give jungkook a quick peck on the cheek , which jimin keeps insisting on you doing before you take your leave . surprisingly , jungkook ’s chair scrapes sharply on the floor ( the old lady at the counter who was dozing off is suddenly awakened and a little pissed off ) and says he will walk you to your house , a tradition he seems to want to practise after the run - in with the drunk dude . comfortable silence falls between you and him as he intertwines his long fingers with yours . both of you stroll down the street slowly . you look at the bright moon gleaming silently in the night sky and you think to yourself - huh , how you wished you could be the moon and never sleep so you could explore the night freely . with jungkook . and the thought of his warm presence makes you feel warm and fuzzy . you ’d be blatantly lying to yourself if you admitted that you did not enjoy jungkook ’s company at night , as he laced his fingers with yours tightly . but of course , the thought gets tucked into the side of your brain and goes unspoken . you glance at him and realize he has been staring right at you the entire time and your face immediately pinks , though you are thankful the darkness of the night conceals it completely .   “ why are you staring at me ? ” you ask with a soft chuckle and shy away from his intense gaze . the next thing he said was definitely something you were not expecting . “ because i like you . ” he blurts it out so softly , as if he was trying to make it clear to himself . he says it so softly you almost could n’t catch his whisper drifting through the wind at night . were you dreaming ? when you do n’t say anything , he stutters and explains hastily , “ urgh , that was too quick , was n’t it ? you do n’t , erm , you do n’t have to you know - say anything ! i was just … ” the depth of his words do n’t sink in until a few moments later - and you do n’t exactly know how you cut him off by tip - toeing and giving him a little peck on the soft skin of his cheek , right on the tiny scar of his left cheek , “ shut up idiot , i like you too ! ” the look on jungkook ’s face quickly changes , and he looks at you like with so much adoration in the crescents that are his eyes , and his arms involuntarily circle around your waist to pull you closer . “ oh my god , ” he breathes in relief as your arms wrap around his neck , and you can definitely picture the soft smile on his face as he rests his head in the crevice of your jaw and neck . “ i thought you did n’t like me ! ” that night ended with him sending you off at the backdoor of your house with a quick kiss to your nose and it had made you impossible to fall asleep that night despite the fact that you have been dying to sleep that day . but when you did , you could feel the pleasant tingle on your nose and the fluttering butterflies in your stomach , even in your dreams . finals roll up eventually and the day right after that was the first official date you ’ve ever went on with jungkook . unlike all the other times you ’ve spent devouring instant ramen and talking about life into the wee hours of the morning , jungkook takes you on a date at the break of dawn . so you actually wake up with swollen eyes from the lack of sleep , but the thought of jungkook is enough to get your morning going without coffee , which is shockingly rare . after going through the heap of clothes in your closet , you finally decide on a casual outfit : your burgundy dress with floral prints that accentuates your figure well and a pair of timberlands , something rhy thinks will definitely make jungkook go weak in his knees . smiling into the mirror , you tilt your head at your reflection and mentally pray , y / n , do n’t do something that will screw up the date , you dumbass . rhy is n’t wrong , because when jungkook comes to pick you up , his breath hitches in his throat and his eyes sparkles like stardust in the cosmo . he gives you a little grin while holding your hand in his large ones and that was enough to make the sky swirl and the ground shake . he takes your hand and walks you to the neighborhood park you had always visited as a child , feeding the pigeons on the benches .   the sky is still an abyss of black with the hints of orange painting the sky . upon reaching the park , he leads you to an unfamiliar corner in the park , walking through a thick canopy of pine trees . you could hear the faint , mellow trickling of a stream getting steadily louder as you headed closer . a few minutes later , jungkook settles down on the ground next to a lake , which you were still unable to see properly because of the darkness of the early morning . he removes his shoes and dips his toes into the cooling water . you find yourself doing the same , despite the fact that there are slippery mossy rocks jutting into your backside and that your dress is probably getting soaked by the second .   when you turn around to face jungkook , he looks at you adoringly , with a slight curve at the ends of his lips . the world around you seemed to slow down when jungkook looks at you with stardust in his eyes .   you do n’t remember who leaned in first , but you ended up with your forehead against his , lips grazing each other ’s . if you had just leaned in a little more , you would have known what those rosy lips of his would have tasted like . you ’re so close you can memorize the curve of his mouth , the little moe underneath it , the rosy tint of his cheeks and the slightest flecks of hazel in his brown orbs . except the passionate moment ends all too abruptly with him clearing his throat awkwardly and pulling back to exclaim , “ let ’s go up ! ” you let the past few moments soak in as you follow him , barefooted , up a supposed pavilion , managing to croak out a weak , “ yeah . ” you have to say - you were really upset . but of course , if he was n’t ready , then you definitely were n’t going to force it on him . the desire to kiss him floods your senses and you feel nothing but exhilaration wash over you when the distance between you closed .   as you look out at the sun , the light drifts into your world , painting it like a canvas , igniting every crevice of the land with its brilliant orange . you spot , from the corner of your eye , a gentle stream of torrent cascading over a series of bedrocks and falling gently into the lake . the birds sing a melodious background music in your presence , and you honestly have n’t see anything more beautiful .   “ oh my god , jungkook , this is - it ’s   absolutely   amazing . thank you , ” you breathed , eyes glued to the orange rays illuminating the morning sky , overlooking the glistening lake .   “ you ’re welcome , ” jungkook replies , the golden glow of the sun bringing out the mellow hues in his eyes , “ i ’ve always loved this place - the sunrise has always been beautiful . ” you tear your eyes away from the mesmerising colors and turn to jungkook .   and you were so surprised , because if the scenery was pretty , then jungkook was positively glowing in the sun that day . he was helplessly drawn into the moment , the brilliant reds and oranges bleeding into his eyes and the soft rays kissing his skin . he was glistening and you could almost picture the aura around him sparkling in the pinks and blues of the clouded sky .   when he looked into your eyes and came forth to pull you into a tight embrace , your heart leaped and you wondered if he could feel the erratic beating of your heart .   as he leans back , something in his eyes changes and the sudden tension in the air made you shake . his parted lips and the rich chocolate in his eyes steal your breath , as he runs a hand over the soft waterfall of your hair , long fingers grazing your neck . you ca n’t help but rest your forehead against his , the scent of mint and a tinge of citrus mixed with tobacco flooding your senses .   suddenly , you ca n’t breathe , because his whisper ghosts over your lips , “ i ’m sorry , y / n , but i do n’t think i can control this anymore . ” “ control what ? ” you ask in confusion , staring as jungkook closes the gap between you and him . before you can figure out what was going on , he starts to lean in , and so did you . but nothing was stopping you this time . your eyes flutter close and you run your fingers down up torso to settle around his neck .   and then , he kissed you , and suddenly the rest of the world did n’t matter anymore . all you could feel is soft lips moving slowly and delicately against yours , his thumb caressing your cheek as your breaths become one . they say you get all giddy and feel fireworks when you kiss someone you like , but all you could feel was fucking fire being lit up in the pit of your stomach , the gentle graze of his lips making bombs go off - it was electrifying . you want nothing but more of him - no , you want all of him to you , and you wished he had felt the same in that moment .   it was perfect , precisely what you would have wanted your first kiss to be , and exactly the way you described it to be in the convenience store , the first time you met him - flying in the pinks and blues of the sky at sunrise . now you understood why he pulled back at the lake - because he had wanted this kiss to be special to me and only for me . your heart was practically exploding with joy .   his hands run down your spine and rests on your hip as he pulls back a little , both of you still inhaling deeply . you are in a state of emptiness , skin still buzzing from his touch , the heat of his lips still lingering over yours .   “ y / n , i like you a lot , ” he whispered against your lips gravely , “ and i may not know how to do this , but could you please do me a favor and be my girlfriend ? ” you throw your head back in laughter and boop his nose cutely , “ of course ! i like you a lot too ! ” he then pecked your lips chastely as you entangled your fingers in his disheveled hair and when you both pull back , you decide to indulge yourself in the beautiful scenery of the sunrise and small talk about sweet little nothings with jungkook . “ is n’t the moon beautiful ? ” he starts , after a long while of silence . curious , you shook your head and asked , “ yes , why do you ask ? ” jungkook sighs simply , “ i do n’t know ; just look at the moon in the corner , do n’t you feel sad ? ” with your face upturned and eyes diverted from the brightness of the sun , you glance at the silver crescent casting gentle silks of rays behind thin yellow clouds . but the fading moon was soundlessly glowing in its whiteness while the rising sun dipped the lake with gorgeous colors that kept the sky vivid with its pure scattering illumination .   because the moon was beautiful , but who would choose it over the magnificent golden orb that stole your breath    away .   he took you to many other places too , like a closed off street to the back of the convenience store - something you have n’t ever realized in all the years you lived right down the street . you brought a few colors of chalk and doodled on the black asphalt of the road - from dank memes of spongebob , to cute drawings of each other . he brought you to a secluded farmers’ market nearing the edge of your town and it was the perfect place to get a little tipsy with some brewed beer in your system , debate about the best smelling candle and even learn to make coffee ( which he managed to make a fool out of himself from dislocating the portafilter body from its handle ) . an old lady sitting at the carrot stand pointed out how cute both of you were and said you were just like “ me and my husband , back in the day ” . there were the juicy steaks you both ca n’t afford at the high - end restaurants , the torrents of waves brushing your legs at the beach , the squeals of excitement with ice - cream smeared over your face on your daily escapades at the ice - cream stand ( jungkook loves ice - cream ) . you were falling in love with him like the moon fell for the sun , finding yourself orbiting around the sun while it draws you nearer . it was getting harder to look at the sun rise and set on the grassy hills , bringing out colors you have n’t yet seen in his eyes , but not being to whisper those three words that always get stuck in your throat . maybe it ’s the hidden glint in his dazed eyes as he stared straight into your soul in the shield of darkness of your room , across cheap target candles laid out lazily on the bedroom floor . maybe it ’s the way he looks at you lovingly in the morning with bed sheets and duvets tangled around his bare torso , before snapping back into reality , pulling his plain tee across his head and dragging his leather jacket over a shoulder , before the first ring of your mom ’s alarm . or maybe it ’s the way he squeezes your hand back without an inch of hesitance as both of you sit on the high chairs of the convenience store , never seeming to get enough of the taste of each other ’s lips . so you were beyond glad when he told you he loved you for the first time , after he kissed you right under the stars , at the tip of the ferris wheel , at the night market . “ i think it ’s a little early for me to say this , but it just feels right now , ” he murmured , voice husky against your lips , “ y / n , i love you . ” your eyes were nearly brimming with tears when you breathe out , almost in relief , as if you had been underwater your whole life and finally surfaced , “ jungkook , i love you too . ” he presses you against him and you allow yourself to melt in his grasp , burrowing yourself in his arms and inhaling the mesmerizing tobacco and mint from his neck . he gives you a slow kiss , soft lips moving against yours as you both descend from the night sky .   you barely make out something about a next date at the park between kisses , but it does n’t happen , because he arrives at the neighbourhood park with fresh bruises decorating his face and a bad limp a few days later . being a med student yourself , you ’ve come across the injured students across the campus from time to time , and you try to commit yourself to fulfill your duty . but none of their injuries unveiled much underlying emotions when you looked at them , yet jungkook was able to make your heart ache . you forgo the happenings of a potential date in a snap of a finger and try your very best to support a heavy jungkook back home .   when you finally arrive at your room not so quietly with a uncooperatively loud jungkook pressing his weight on your shoulder , you shake him off and help him settle on your bean bag while you ponder about how none of your limbs have dislocated from withstanding jungkook ’s weight .   an otherworldly sense of déjà vu hits you full when jungkook looks up at you timidly and gnaws on his bottom lip to draw blood , tongue flicking out to caress the wound . you halt in your movements when your thoughts send you into phases of flashbacks .   you only snap out of your reverie when jungkook pulls his white shirt over his head , because you were definitely not ready for the exposial of rock hard abdominal muscles . you always knew , somewhere at the back of your mind , that jungkook was awfully built , but you did n’t expect such defined abs from the same person that was stuffing instant ramen in his face not too long ago .   you blink furiously to focus on the task at hand and started cleaning his wounds . his wounds definitely delved deeper into his skin compared to the previous time , so you apply more pressure on his wounds .    in return , jungkook just grunts heavily and juts his bottom lip out , “ are you sure this is antiseptic you ’re applying ? it feels like you ’re setting fire on my skin ! ” “ you do know i can easily replace this antiseptic cream with alcoholic swabs that will sting like a bitch , right ? ” you snap at him and press down a little harder on the wound . he clamps his mouth shut but still releases an unappreciative snort in your direction .   “ but you wo n’t , cuz you love me , right ? ” he sticks his tongue out playfully ,   you move hastily to the first aid box and reach in to dig out an alcoholic swab . just as you were about to toss it to jungkook ’s direction , he offers his best kicked puppy look and widens his eyes at you , “ y / nnnnnnnnnn , i love you so much ! ! your highness , i have sinned , what should i do for you in return ? ” “ maybe you can tell me why you got hurt today , ” you say , but your tone is lighthearted and playful as you reach into the first aid kit for some bandage .   the shift in atmosphere is so sudden it scares you . the air stills between you when he freezes at your unexpected answer , smile dropping . he takes a couple of seconds before replying . “ y / n , actually , i have to tell you something . ” the curved smirk hanging from his lips is now pursed into a line , and the emotionless expression he wears just adds on to the tension . you notice his erratic breathing when he asks , “ would you still love me the same ? even after i tell you … ” you stop unrolling the bandage and walk forth to caress his smooth cheek , pressing a light kiss on jungkook ’s bottom lip , and assuring him you ’ll love him no matter what . and the truth rolls off his tongue , his voice becoming hoarse from the hitch in his breath , “ y / n , i work at bts . ” bts - bangtan sonyeondan - probably the most notorious gang in your generation . starting out as a handful of hooligans in the field of street racing , the gang has expanded to sabotage large - scale events of their rivals , claiming innocent lives in the process . you look down at all the wounds peppering over his body , ones you now notice are from sharp stabs and painful punches , and your eyes drift slowly to his taut muscles , ones from years of giving hard shoves to anyone in their way and pushing against the uniformed authorities . you peer at his calloused hand wrapping your small ones , and think about all the guns he had potentially touched in his life .   a shiver runs down from your head to the bottom of your spine when you finally realize you ’re dating a criminal . you want to shake his hands off you , but you ca n’t help circling your hands around his long fingers , and you do n’t know why but this feeling is wild and overwhelming and he is absolutely irresistible .   “ and i … i … ” he struggles to get the next words out of his mouth and just stutters mindlessly for the next few seconds , idly fiddling with his thumbs . “ and you what ? ” you urge softly , leaning closer , placing your hand against his cheek softly and caressing it lightly . “ and i hit people . ” he finishes in a soft whimper , wincing slightly as the words leave his mouth , collapsing into your arms when you pull him into a tight hug . and it remains silent for the next few minutes , with you brushing feather - like touches on his back and him just breathing in the smell of your shampoo . “ anyway , ” he finally clears his throat , “ i just thought you should know , since we ’re together and all that . ” “ yeah , you know i ’ll love you no matter what … ” you reassure as you lie down on the bed . he whispers that he loves you too , before pulling you into his arms , allowing you to nuzzle your face into the curve of his neck , peppering chaste pecks along his jaw , inhaling the raw mixture of tobacco and mint . “ why do you never smoke in front of me ? ” you point out , trying to ease the tension and leave him to whisper something cheesy about you bringing the best out of him . “ i ’m actually trying to quit , ” he mutters , voice genuine as he shakes his ruffled fringe out of his eyes . “ why now ? ” you were getting sleepy from the calming mixtures radiating off jungkook and stifled a yawn in his shoulder , “ why do you even smoke ? ” “ to forget . ” “ forget what ? ” dozing off , you managed another question before sleep pulled you in . he just tucks a few strands of hair behind your ear and whispered into it softly . you almost miss the hidden emotions laced in his voice , so carefully swathed it is disguised as the truth that flows freely in the river of life . “ pain . ” you should have seen it coming sooner , should have known there was something wrong from that one morning when you rolled to your side on a cold bed , all presence of jungkook vanished . had you been able to foresee the future , at least you could ’ve stopped it - stopped him . now that you look back on it , the last few dates he took you on felt different , an air of tension suspending between the both of you . when you looked him in the eye , there was nothing but emptiness behind his chocolate orbs and you could n’t feel the fire from the trail of touches he left in your skin . the convenience store became an unfamiliar environment , its plain walls no longer carrying whispers in the darkness of the night . when the rest of the world sleeps , the night wakes up , but you just feel something is missing when you look down at the cold concrete tiles of the convenience store as they stare back at you . was jungkook not arriving anytime soon ? but it was a friday … then , a message straight to voicemail , but jungkook never misses any of your calls , ever . that was the first suspicion . the ice - cream guy who worked at the entrance of the park , someone jungkook claimed he was close with , says he does n’t know of jungkook ’s whereabouts . surely , jungkook must n’t have gone that many days without ice cream ? you decide to ignore the strange feeling residing in your stomach for the second time . maybe he ’s just busy .    the last time happens on a tuesday night you were supposed to spend with him in the theatres , hope blossoming in your chest as you wait around to spot the familiar mop of hair and signature doe eyes . but you walk down the cold street by yourself , breath forming misty clouds . he never disappears on dates , not without any prior notice . and that is the third time and the final straw ; you can not brush away jungkook ’s disappearance nonchalantly . it was close to three in the morning when you found your legs carrying you to the convenience store unconsciously , insanity driving you to pound your fists on the cashier ’s counter and choke out , “ him ! the guy always seated there , with the skinny boyfriend jeans and leather jackets ! ” the old lady , whose unnaturally dark tousled bangs with a tinge of purple finally showed some signs of recognition and handed you a pretty envelope from the underside of the counter . she just gives you a sorry look and settles down on the stool behind the counter , “ bless you , young lady , the guy loves you a lot . ” you glance at her curiously before taking a seat beside the window , on your usual place , and literally ripping the envelope open to run your eyes over the content . dear y / n , hey , i might ’ve already been gone when you read this . i ’ve finally left this place after stopping myself from doing just that so many times . i had to leave because of all the horrid memories i have for this town , but every time i stepped out of the door , you stopped me . i love you so much it hurts to let go , but i have already given up hope for this empty town . i ’m sorry if i hurt you , but i hope you know you deserve better .   a never - ending stream of tears flowed down your cheeks as your wavering hands clutched the thin paper . your knees buckled to the ground at the last sentence . i love you to the moon and back . you can not imagine the look on your face , with hot salty tears dripping down your chin and your eyes watery . you did n’t know the lady from the counter was beside you before you felt arms wrap around your waist . no words were exchanged between you and her when your tears soaked her shirt and the pauses for gasps of air echoed in the store .   the pain must have crashed into you like waves , because one moment you were standing up to leave the store , and one moment you were hurling yourself into the old lady ’s arms to start sobbing again . you have so many unanswered questions , but you do n’t know where to start . she is quiet when you tell her everything about jungkook between recovery breathes and muffled sobs , and when you finally stop crying , she gives you a loving pat on your shoulder and says , “ he loves you - that boy , and love wo n’t give up on itself . ” love . what a complicated emotion .   and you wonder if you will ever feel it ever again , when you are with another man that is not   him . he was like the first rays of the sun , so bright and so beautiful as it shone over the horizon .   in that fleeting moment , it looks at the moon and kisses her gently with its gleam , so gently she almost misses it . almost . but how could you miss it , when there would be no other light in the sky but him . and how could you , when you were too close to the sun ?\n",

       "17022254    “ whatcha lookin’ at , pretty boy ? ” the male asked gruffly without looking at him , smoke coming from his lips in uncharacteristically beautiful curls , framing his face in the dim lighting . jungkook looked away , hoping that the darkness of the alleyway was enough to overpower the light of the flickering neon signs and keep his face hidden under his hood . “ nothing . ” he replied , casting his eyes down momentarily only to slowly drag them back up , chin held straight . the mysterious man let out a fit of laughter , tilting his head back . it was the laughter of a broken man , rebuilt only to be broken again . insanity laced the sound — like many of the things in the world — giving it a bittersweet timbre . he hummed , snapping his head forward again and looking jungkook straight in the eye . jungkook ’s breath caught at the back of his throat . he brought his index and middle fingers to his lips , cigarette held between them familiarly , and took another slow , relaxed drag , the end glowing a warm orange . “ do n’t b’lieve ya , kiddo . ” he breathed out , his words seeming to birth the smoke . jungkook could n’t draw his gaze away , no matter how hard he tried . “ then do n’t . ” he replied simply , against his better judgement , sounding a little breathless in his own ears . the male narrowed his fox - like eyes at jungkook , allowing a few more seconds to pass with their gazes interlocked . then , with a final drag and its following curls of smoke , he dropped the cigarette to the ground , crushing it under his foot without looking . “ th’ name ’s yoongi . min yoongi . ” he finally voiced after the suffocating silence , waiting for a response . it took jungkook a moment to formulate one . “ i- i ’m … jeon jungkook . ” something i got inspiration for in spanish class , i might turn it into an actual fic ? thoughts ?

       "81836       stoneyboboney : squeesbysophie : wyvernchick : dragonsquillwrites : saucywenchwritingblog : i ’ve seen five different authors take down , or prepare to take down , their posted works on ao3 this week .    at the same time , i ’ve seen several people wishing there was more new content to read .    i ’ve also seen countless posts by authors begging for people to leave comments and kudos .       people tell me i am a big name fan in my chosen fandom .    i do n’t quite get that but for the purposes of this post , let ’s roll with it .    on my latest one shot , less than 18 % of the people who read it bothered to hit the kudos button .    sure , okay , maybe that one sort of sucked .    let ’s look at the one shot posted before that - less than 16 % left kudos .    before that - 10 % , and then 16 % .    i ’m not even going to get into the comments .    let ’s just say the numbers drop a lot .    i ’m just looking at one shots here so we do n’t have to worry about multiple hits from multiple chapters , people reading previous chapters over , etc .    and if i am a bnf , that means other people are getting significantly less kudos and comments . fandom is withering away because it feels like people do n’t care about the works that are posted .    why should i go to the trouble of posting my stories if no one reads them , and of the people who do read them , less than a fifth like them ?    even if you are not a huge fan of the story , if it kept your attention long enough for you to get to the bottom , go ahead and mash that kudos button .    it ’s a drop of encouragement in a big desert .       tl;dr : passively devouring content is killing fandom . ^^^^^^this^^^^^^ fandom is kept alive by readers , watchers , lookers , commenters , and supporters .    and the fiki fandom has some magnificent ones … but a lot more who click , consume , and say nothing . otherwise , artists and writers are throwing into a vacuum . and it ’s the artists and writers who get blamed when there ’s not new content ? this applies to so many fandoms . it makes me so sad to see that even on lj comms , there are far more people reading things than there are commenting on and liking them .   i co - mod one of the oldest sites in a particular fandom , and i know it ’s still active because of the sign - ups for our challenges , but it ’s so disheartening when people post and nobody says anything .   how does that encourage new writers , if the first thing they post gets no response ? i cheerlead our comm on twitter , where a lot of the members hang out , and still nothing .   it makes me feel like people are eventually going to just stop , and then i shall be sad , because if nobody ’s posting and nobody ’s reading , there ’s little point in my writing and drawing either .   i do n’t know why fandom is getting so heavily skewed towards passive consumption , but i wish i could do something - anything - to fix it .   i miss the kind of comment threads that used to lead directly to more fic and art .      and there ’s the answer , random fan demanding more fic but not actually doing anything to encourage it .   if you want us to create stuff , let us know we ’re not shouting into the void .   engage with us .   discuss plot points with us .   we create for ourselves - but we post for you . creators love kudos , comments , and feedback .   take a few moments and give it to them .   it means so much . i think people dl'ding fic to their kindles ( which , yay ! ) is a part of this , too . they enjoy it , they re - read it , but they do n’t go back to ao3 to leave a kudos or comment . perhaps folks could make a point that after they ’ve read x number of stories , they pull out their kindles / ereaders and go back to the ao3 and leave something for the fics they enjoyed ? ( note : this is what i do about once a month . )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

almost like they were painted on . in the distance , coiling and roiling , despite the rest of the world being caught between one heartbeat and the next , the last few scuds of the thing john had destroyed boiled in the sky , a low buzzing drone filling the air . for a long moment , dave did n’t dare move , unsure of what he had done - was - doing - would - do . he ’d never seen anything like this before , but he knew it was bad , especially since the thing kept coming , closer and closer , twisting sinuously through the air , defying gravity and frozen time alike . dave moved without thinking , drawing his sword , the whole blade hot to the touch in his hand . do n’t you fucking dare , he thought . he knew that the thing was coming for john , straight for his heart , his weakness

       "565647      ao3 link / ffnet link summary : sasuke knew as much as anyone about soul marks . every injury his soulmate got would reflect on his skin in color , which was normal . a little slash of color here or there as his soulmate got nicked by a kunai or stumbled while making dinner was to be expected . if they healed up without scarring , then the mark would be gone like it had never been there in the first place . there was n’t even any pain . soul marks that reflected endless , permanently scarred bite marks from the age of six onward were emphatically not a good sign regarding his soulmate ’s situation in life . ————– please read the trigger warnings first . this story deals with some very unsavory subjects due to the nature of the soulmate - identifying marks and the characters involved , as a result of the backstory that canon provides for karin , and the assumptions and theories that people make based on her scars and the locations of such . i was reading soulmate fics in a different fandom and , as per usual , started trying to imagine similar concepts applied to other fandoms . i realized that applying this particular soulmate mark type to sasukarin would likely be pretty angsty , so i tried writing it . … it ended up much , much darker than expected . i ’m almost regretting posting it , just because of the subject matter . it ’s not meant to be misery porn , just … an exploration of a concept in relation to some characters with dark childhoods that were n’t given the respect they deserved .

       "26936087    barbex : inkshaming : so , i posted a fic today , and as i was setting up the ao3 post , i found myself writing in the end notes an impassioned - almost desperate , ngl - plea for comments . for interaction . and yeah , for validation too . because you know what ? writing is hard - despite commonly held misconceptions , it takes a shit - ton of effort to take some blank , empty void of a page and fill it with something   that lives and breathes and touches the minds and hearts of others .      and do n’t you dare wave that   “ you should be writing for yourself ” bullshit in my face . it ’s been a long , long time since i ’ve been able to do that , and honestly i ’m glad managed to recover as much as i have and write as much as i do . having an audience is an integral part of the writing process . let me repeat that . having an audience is an integral part of the writing process . we fanfic authors do n’t ask for much . as someone who is a published author , who has been published in a real physical book ™ and was paid hundreds of dollars in honest - to - god cold - hard cash for less work than i put into my fanfic , let me tell you , a few comments will not pay my tuition or buy my groceries or put clothes on my back . compared to the hours of labor that went into earning the money i was paid with , comments take substantially less time to create . and yet , to us , they are priceless . authors will create entire worlds for the sake of making a single person smile . you can be that person . we will write for you happily . you just have to let us know you care . and you ’d better do it soon . i ’ve heard too many authors all too willing to pull their tumblrs and erase or abandon their fics on ao3 because they have grown weary of screaming into the void . that fanfic you love ? gone . that chapter you ’re waiting for ? never gon na happen . how many of you have bookmark lists with fics already missing ? i bet you wo n’t even remember which one it is . you can keep that from happening . just write   “ omg thank you for updating , i really liked _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ! ” and fill in the blank . someone worked hard to put that smile on your face . you can make them smile in return . “ and do n’t you dare wave that “ you should be writing for yourself ” bullshit in my face . “ this so fucking much ! ! writers write to be read ! writers write to be read .

( read on ao3 ) — neville longbottom was n’t an aggressive bloke , in fact , many considered him irrefutably docile in spite of his actions during the war . he did n’t seem to mind the implication , or at least he did n’t ever refute it . neville was a scholarly man , quite contented to mix with his flora populations than any gathering people put on . still , that did n’t stop him from going down to the local pub with his girlfriend and his mates . they had a good time , the lot of them , but there was always one thing neville could n’t stand . and it would happen every night , without fail . someone would try and pick up his girl . it was little wonder really . she was rather beautiful after all . and the infrequent patrons of the establishment tended to verge on the wasted side of their pints , leading emboldened men to voice their opinions of her openly and directly . men had always done this with pansy . neville had seen it firsthand throughout their schooling years , but he had n’t had his arm around her waist then . neville was n’t a brute , and as head of gryffindor , he did his best to teach his students there were means beyond physical altercation that could lend to their bravery . however , that did n’t mean it was off the table . it only meant that neville did n’t consider himself brave when he acted upon those impulses . pushed too far , as his mates would later claim , neville had already tolerated his fair share of contenders tonight . pansy ’s mood was sullied with their continuously unwelcomed advances and she leaned against neville ’s chest , clearly placing herself within his personal space . they were unquestioningly , a couple . and even the blindest wizard could see that , but that did n’t stop the most belligerent of the blokes at the bar . neville was polite , more so than pansy ’s immediate rejection , but even his patience quickly wore thin at the man ’s persistence . he could n’t hex him , because it went against his beliefs , but neville did something equally as satisfying . taking a powerful swing at the bloke , neville cut the man ’s vulgar speech off midsentence , and causing him to stumble to the floor at the sheer force of the blow . neville stood unmoving over the unconscious man for a long moment before stalking determinedly toward the loo . pansy followed him swiftly , though no one else dared to move , all too shocked to see the cheery gryffindor react so . “ neville- ” pansy started , halting as the bathroom door closed behind her . cradling his hand to his chest now , neville smiled at her , pain bringing a glimmer to his eyes , “ sorry love , could n’t help myself . ” “ neville ! ” pansy seethed , stalking toward her gentle giant , “ do n’t you dare . he had it coming . if you had n’t , you know i would ’ve hexed boils onto his crotch . ” neville had to laugh at her anger , knowing the place of concern it came from . she had a wicked temper , and more than once he ’d had to save pansy from her own nature . “ let me see your hand , ” pansy demanded , ushering the requested appendage forth with an open palm . neville gave in easily , wincing as she touched the damaged knuckles , “ you should n’t hit people though , you ’re rubbish at it . ” “ he , and the rest of them … ” neville sighed , “ you know i wo n’t hex them , i ca n’t . i just want them to leave you- us- alone . ” “ you could always let me … ” pansy said , correcting her thought as the frown deepened on neville ’s face , “ i know , i know . ” allowing pansy to heal him , neville grasped her hands pleadingly , “ promise me you wo n’t , ever . ” “ neville … ” ” promise me , pansy . please ? ” “ … i promise , ” “ thank you … ” he sighs .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

( note that this is actually a bit better than average representaton - wise - female representation in popular media franchises is typicaly well below the 25 % contemplated here . ) assuming that any character can be shipped with any other without regard for age , gender , social position or prior relationship - and for simplicity excluding cloning , time travel and other “ selfcest”-enabling scenarios - this yields the following ( non - polyamorous ) possibilities : possible f / f ships : 3 possible f / m ships : 27 possible m / m ships : 36 total possible ships : 66 thus , assuming - again , for the sake of simplicity - that every possible ship is about equally likely to appeal to any given fan , we ’d reasonably expect about ( 36/66 ) = 55 % of all shipping - related media to feature m / m pairings . no particular prejudice in favour of male characters and/or against female characters is necessary for us to get there . the point is this : before we can conclude that representation in shipping is being skewed by fan prejudice , we have to ask how skewed it would be even in the absence of any particular prejudice on the part of the fans . or , to put it another way , we have to ask ourselves : are we criticising women in fandom - and let ’s be honest here , this type of criticism is almost exclusively directed at women - for creating a representation problem , or are we merely criticising them for failing to correct an existing one ? yes yes yes holy shit yes fucking thank you ! also food for thought : the obvious correction to a lack of non - male representation in a story is to add more non - males . female original characters are often decried as self - insertion or mary sues , particular if romance or sex is a primary focus . i really appreciate when tumblr commentary is of the quality i might see at an academic conference . no joke . this does n’t even account   for the disparity in the amount of screen time / dialogue male characters to get in comparison to female characters , and how much time other characters spend talking about male characters even when they are n’t onscreen . this all leads to male characters ending up more fully developed , and more nuanced than female characters . the more an audience feels like they know a character , the more likely an audience is to care about a character . more network television writers are men . male writers tend to understand men better than women , statistically speaking .   female characters are more likely to be written by men who do n’t understand women vary well .      but it ’s easier to blame the collateral damage than solve the root problem . yay , mathy arguments . :) this is certainly one large factor in the amount of m / m slash out there , and the first reason that occurred to me when i first got into fandom ( i do n’t think it ’s the sole reason , but i think it ’s a bigger one than some people in the why so much slash debate give our credit for ) . and nice point about adding female ocs . in some of my shipping - related stats , i found that shows with more major female characters lead to more femslash ( also more het ) .   ( e.g. femslash in female - heavy media ; femslash deep dive ) i ’ve never actually tried to do an analysis to pin down how much of fandom ’s m / m preference is explained by the predominance of male characters in the source media , but i ’m periodically tempted to try to do so . all great points . another thing i notice is that many shows are built around the idea that the team or the partner is the most important thing in the universe . watch any buddy cop show , and half of the episodes have a character on a date that is inevitably interrupted because the job comes first … except   “ the job ” actually means   “ my partner ” . when it ’s a male - female buddy show , all of the failed relationships are usually , canonically , because the leads belong together . ( look at early bones : she dates that guy who is his old friend and clearly a stand - in for him . they break up because * coughcoughhandwave*. that stuff happens constantly . ) male - male buddy shows write the central relationship the exact same way except that they expect us to read it as platonic . long before it becomes canon , the potential ship of mulder / scully or booth / bones or whatever lead male / female couple consumes the fandom . it ’s not about the genders involved . rizzoli / isles was like this too . if canon tells us that no other relationship has ever measured up to this one , why should we keep them apart ? do n’t like slash of your shows , prissy writers ? then stop writing all of your leads locked in epic one true love romance novel relationships with their same - sex coworkers . give them warm , funny , interesting love interests , not cardboard cutouts … and then we will ship an ot3 . if you look at the once upon a time archive on ao3 , you ’ll see that femslash is far more prominent than slash , or even the biggest het ship . the regina / emma pairing is the most popular pairing , with roughly 1000 more stories to it than the second most popular pairing of emma / hook . this is not an isolated incident , i ’m sure , but it ’s interesting to look at why the ratio is so different as compared to many other fandom archives . i think , in part and building on what destinationtoast said , ouat has such a popular femslash pairing because the protagonist and antagonist are both women and have a lot of screen time together . their relationship evolves incredibly and has so many layers added to it over the course of the show , and all of that nuance creates so much potential for fans to play with - the sort of nuance that you typically only get between male characters .         @lobobathory then stop writing all of your leads locked in epic one true love romance novel relationships with their same - sex coworkers . give them warm , funny , interesting love interests , not cardboard cutouts … and then we will ship an ot3 . this is exactly what happened with white collar - the ( relatively close ) second most popular ship of the fandom is elizabeth / peter / neal . el is peter ’s wife and a beloved , well - developed character with her own complexities . peter / neal fits the buddy cop trope , but elizabeth is rarely shafted from the relationship because there ’s no need for her to be . she ’s a character that is fully developed , not some kind of cardboard cut - out romantic interest who only exists for her husband , and the elizabeth / peter relationship is realistic , pleasant and very difficult not to love .      another example is leverage . the top ship for this fandom is hardison / parker / eliot . three well - developed characters . time spent equally on all of them during the show . their dynamic is equal with each other ; there ’s not more time spent developing hardison / eliot just because they ’re men , leading to an even shipping field .      this is really only in relation to ot3′s stemming from same - sex buddy - cop style relationships + a well written female character , but still . shows what decent writing can prompt , anyway .\n",

( i forgot that was the name of their label , tbh . that ’s on me . ) not exactly having to do with princesses here , but it does have to do with holding disney accountable for more than just money . since i figured the followers of this blog are interested in conscious consumption and better representation , i think that no few of you would be deeply offended by the idea of nazi cap . especially considering how marvel keeps doubling down .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "27049337    feverhalo : part 2 to this fic here . it took a while , and part 3 may take a while longer still , i have much less than i did for part 2 started as of this posting . i hope it lives up to what everyone has been waiting for . i am also going to post it on ao3 tonight , both parts . so if you want a better way to track it , you can bookmark the page here .      this chunk is 4083 words or so . content warnings for anxiety descriptions , vaguely described medical procedures / needles . part 2 shiro left lance , squared away in his bed with an intercom button near by , his headphones on , phone in hand , and eyes closed . he sighed , wondering how on … well not earth , anymore , he got into this . he ran a hand through his hair and blew out a breath , getting ready to try and corral the pandemonium that allura seemed to be part of , for a change . “ okay , okay , everyone time to focus . ” shiro started as he entered the kitchen again . pidge and keith seemed to be wrapping up their re - telling of events to hunk , who looked torn between enjoying it and feeling like he should scold them on his friend ’s behalf . “ is he okay ? you were gone for a while . ” “ took him a bit to scrub off the marker , and i wanted to make sure he ’d take medicine if he needed it . its … not great . he ’ll be okay though . ” he leveled a look at the three guilty parties . “ i ’m disappointed . he ’s sick and that could have been really mean - spirited . ” “ it was only a prank , ” pidge pouted and keith shrunk in his seat . “ lance is the one who taught me about that anyway . when he wakes up and is less grumpy , he ’ll think its funny . ” “ do n’t make assumptions , pidge- “ “ makes an ass out of you and me , yeah , yeah . ” “ enough of this , come on . we had some really good team work today . we found a lot of good resources , and if we can figure out how to clear that area of hostiles , we could have a really strong point for an alliance there . ”

       "27060165    pocket - anon : i was supposed to work on csbb today .   i did this instead .   blame the show writers and captain swan when i miss this weekend ’s csbb check - in , but i had to get this out of my system .   sorry if it ’s a little slap - dash , lol . a quick and dirty missing scene from 6.18 .   ( canon compliant .   plain smut .   rated m. ) find it on ao3 . tagging    @the - lady - of - misthaven , @noorasaetlre , @villains - happy - ending , and @kmomof4 because you all are enablers .   and @bleebug because she asked for stuff like this . emma shuttles her mother out the door , promising to meet up with the troops at the sheriffs’ station shortly . snow totes her ominously - large wedding planner – as great a harbinger of future suffering as any magical artifact emma ’s ever encountered – down the porch steps , and emma waits until she ’s halfway to the sidewalk before shutting the door and turning the bolt ( for all the good that does ) .      breakfast long forgotten , she flies up the stairs to the bedroom to suit up for another day of dealing with the black fairy ’s machinations .   pulling clean underthings from her dresser drawer , she catches her reflection in the bedroom mirror .   she pauses at the sight of her mussed hair , biting her lip at both the memory of how it got that way and the realization that she definitely needs to see the inside of a shower before they get going – to the wash away the evidence , as it were .   her eyes dart to the closed bathroom door .   the sound of running water coming from within reminds her that their shower is currently occupied and she has to wait until killian vacates it or use the bathroom down the hall . and then option c hits her .      it ’s a great idea .      it ’s a terrible idea . pancakes . she ’s all in .      gods , they ’re going to be so late .      keep reading

       "27082209    kaciart : rocket - sith : francisperfectionbonnefoy : vulgarweed : hiddenlacuna : fluffmugger : madmaudlingoes : tygermama : every time i see more of the   ‘ ao3 is evil’ crap circulating i think , ‘ well , tumblr is evil too and i do n’t see you stop using it’ you know , the more i think about this , the more i think the real complaint is n’t that ao3 hosts “ evil ” content , it ’s that it does n’t allow harassment / dogpiling of “ evil ” creators as easily as tumblr . abuse wo n’t remove or even re - tag a work except in a handful of very specific cases , but they will suspend or ban users for harassment , including filing repeated unfounded abuse reports . authors also have at least some ability to screen / block comments on works , and there ’s no direct messaging system outside of commenting on works through which to pursue harassment . you can follow a creator but you ca n’t block them ( much less encourage others to do the same ) . tumblr , by contrast , generally ignores any abuse report that does n’t involve the dmca , and aggressive anons can and have driven bloggers off the site entirely . the fact that the same tactics are used by social justice bloggers and neo - nazis ( for instance ) does n’t matter – they ’re the affordances of the site , by accident or design , and an entire fannish generation have gotten very used to performing their fannish ( and moral ) identity in this fashion . ( i thinks it ’s relevant that ao3 was designed by fandom ’s lj generation and in some respect mirrors the affordances of lj circa 2010 . tumblr is a very different site and that , moreso than age differences , seems to be at the root of this – though of course age intersect with site experience in a non - trivial way . ) ding ding ding ding . ao3 requires you to police your own consumption of content .    ao3 wo n’t let you destroy someone ’s online presence simply because you do n’t like it .    ao3 wo n’t let you impose your own morality on other without cause . if you have issues with this , and the fact that ao3 requires you to have responsibility and agency ,    then you seriously need to sit down and have a damned good long hard look at yourself . the question i usually fail to see being answered when people bitch about the content on ao3 is - so who gets to decide ? you ? me ? a committee of my friends ? of yours ? of those who have the most kudos ? of those who have no interest in fandom , but want to protect other people from dangerous content , whatever it may be ? who gets that power , and how long will they have it ? who are you comfortable with giving the power of regulating all the content ? what happens in grey areas ? what happens when something you like is n’t liked by the decider ? is there an appeal ? who gets to make the arguments for and against something ? the world is complex and there are no easy answers . the impossibility of creating a censorship board that curates based on content is a great reason why those things do n’t exist , and should n’t . certain people are screaming that ao3 is bad because it ’s not a   “ safe space . ” the real problem they have , though , is that ao3 was created to be a safe space - for writers . and it does a pretty good job of that .    it was designed to be a place where writers are safe from arbitrary content rule changes , random and unwarned deletions , and abuse - report abuse ( which is common on ff.net ) . the four big warnings + cntw system is beautiful in its fairness and simplicity . antis ca n’t take control of it . and because control - freakdom is at the heart of their   “ movement , ” this drives them into frenzies . good . it motivated me to dig a little deeper into my pocket to donate on the last drive . for all the pleasure ao3 has given me over the years , that ’s money well spent . the real problem they have , though , is that ao3 was created to be a safe space - for writers .        preach it loud and hard ! i ’m a member of the lj generation , and when i first came to tumblr ( grudgingly and out of desperation , i might add , since it tragically seems to be the only place to really connect with other fandom peeps ) i was horrified at how people here had established this sort of fucked up bully culture , where nobody is responsible for monitoring their own consumption , and rather they expect everyone else to custom tailor content to the whims and desires of the shrieking banshee masses . and woe be to the person who does n’t bend and break ! “ i ’m going to bully you while accusing you and your big mean poopie content of being the actual bully , so i can hopefully distract you and others from realizing i ’m being a royal intrusive asshat who failed astronomy 101 b / c i clearly believe the world revolves around me . ” the irony here is that this in itself is an abuse tactic - victim blaming with a side of gaslighting . pot , meet kettle . and it ’s the exact same mentality that drives right - wing lunatics to kick up a fuss about the existence of icky cootie gay people in media because we need to “ protect family values ” , or who take to screeching at starbucks because their particular religious symbolism is n’t portrayed on the winter holiday cups and omg war on christmas , starbucks stop oppressing me by not catering to my personal taste . the mentality is one and the same - “ cater to me me me or face my divine wrath even if it means taking away other people ’s freedom ! ” while hiding behind a flimsy - ass shield of faux righteous anger .      and when these bozos find an environment or situation where they ’re unable or not allowed to bully people into silence and submission , they stomp their feet and pitch a tantrum and claim that they ’re the ones being oppressed . identical shit , different pile , and it ’s the exact same infantile , schoolyard rubbish no matter which side it ’s coming from . this was a really interesting read . the last poster in particular but all of it .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "27107839    halespecterwinchester : greaseonmymouth : just - shower - thoughts : my ability to proofread increases by 1000 % after i hit “ submit ” . this is often because when you ’ve submitted something ( like fanfiction to ao3 ) it will be in a different font , size and framing than in your word processor . the text will look different in the new environment so your brain stops skipping what looks familiar ( like a typo that has been there since the beginning ) . so , tip : revise your work in a different font and size . i guarantee you ’ll catch more typos and mistakes than otherwise . for all my writers ( ones i follow and the ones that thankfully follow me )

       "27115135    smolsarcasticraspberry : halespecterwinchester : greaseonmymouth : just - shower - thoughts : my ability to proofread increases by 1000 % after i hit “ submit ” . this is often because when you ’ve submitted something ( like fanfiction to ao3 ) it will be in a different font , size and framing than in your word processor . the text will look different in the new environment so your brain stops skipping what looks familiar ( like a typo that has been there since the beginning ) . so , tip : revise your work in a different font and size . i guarantee you ’ll catch more typos and mistakes than otherwise . for all my writers ( ones i follow and the ones that thankfully follow me ) also it helps if you shift it into a font that ’s a bit more complex and harder to read , like a fancy serif font , because it requires more processing power from the brain and you therefore focus more on what you ’re reading and spot more mistakes .

( if you ever stumble upon it without having asked because someone else @ ’s my new blog or something , you can follow too . i just do n’t want to post the url here openly . ) ( ( also , i ’ll probably start following people whom i followed here whose posts were always important to me tomorrow , so , if you get a follow from a blog you do n’t recognize , chances are it ’s mine . ) ) i think i wo n’t delete this one because i posted a lot of headcanon stuff on here which i still like , especially about my ( and luca ’s ) ocs , but there wo n’t be happening anything anymore on here .

       "27278858    lucibae - is - dancing - in - hell : lucibae - is - dancing - in - hell : what is this paying for ? this will be helping me pay bills , fix both of my vehicles , feed me during my work / school days , and achieve a passport / student visa , as i ’m looking to study outside the us starting fall 2017 if i can swing it . but i can not truly apply unless i have a passport .      ca n’t you just get a job ? i have a job , two of them thank you for asking . but at one i am limited to twenty hours a week and the other due to a financial hit i am not only on reduced pay but on reduced hours ( not to mention this boss is a chauvinistic ass who keeps insisting that when his girlfriend dies / finally breaks up with him that we ’ll be together ; he also likes telling me i ’m working and then cancel on me last minute for petty reasons ) .        price : $ 5 for every 500 words . i know the minimum is $ 3 on ko - fi , but i am very bad at math and want to save you the headaches ( also nice even numbers ) amount : i will close commissions either every 10 commissions or every 10k words requested . limits : obviously , i will not write somethings . you can check out my blog for an idea of what i will end up writing . for sure nos include : non - con , extreme underage ( like under 16 y / o ) , scat , watersports , unsafe bdsm practices ( such as ignoring a safe word or zero aftercare ) i will write : smut , fluff , or angst that does n’t include any of the above . how will this work : go to the “ buy me a coffee ” button on my blog enter amount and pay when done , private message me on tumblr giving your information or a screencap showing payment . at that time , state what you would like for your fic . this includes pairings , genre , and a general idea . there are three options to getting your fic : you can request that i email you the google doc link to it , no posting to tumblr or ao3 you can request that i post it to tumblr / ao3 , but i do n’t tag you . what i will do is post it and state it was an anonymous commission . after it is posted , i will pm you a link to it so you can have it . you can request that i post it to tumblr / ao3 and allow me to tag you in it . i will be quick about writing your fics , but due to things such as real life they make some time . right now , donation fics are the priority , but the commissions will come first when those come in . if you have any questions , feel free to pm me ! feel free to blacklist “ demon deals ” or “ commissions ” to avoid these posts . hey everyone !      so i just found out that my work study job only has 26 hours left . what this means is in roughly a week i will be out of a job , because my work study job is funded by the school and there is a specified amount set aside . this means i need your help .      while i ’ve mostly figured out what i ’m doing post graduation , neither of my jobs are guaranteed and the job hunt is going to be tedious , if not difficult , especially if i end up moving this summer .      my commissions are open .      if you can not commission , please signal boost .      thank you

       "27300694    thegeminisage : eta : additions to this post ( and fic recs ! ) are in this tag ! you know what the best thing ever is ? it ’s soulmate aus like god damn i have seen so many on ffn / lj / ao3/tumblr over the years like : the one where you only see color once you meet your soulmate(s ) ( so you do n’t know them until you see them ) , and it goes away when they die the one where you do n’t know your soulmate(s ) until you touch them the one where you don'y know your soulmate(s ) until you hear them speak , or hear them speak a certain word ; your name , for example the one where you get the name of the person in their handwriting on your body somewhere at a certain age the one where the first thing they say to you appears instead the one where you get each others’ fingerprints the one where you get matching marks / symbols / tattoos the one where your marks or words that change depending on what ’s going on with your soulmate(s ) the one with the clock that counts down the time until you meet your soulmate(s ) ( multiple clock for multiple soulmates ? one click until you meet them both ? unexpected third soulmate showing up after the clocks drop ? ) the one where when you sleep you dream of whatever they ’re experiencing from their point of view until you find them , or after you find them the one where you can straight up talk to them in dreams until / after you find them the one where you form a telepathic / empathetic link until / after you find them the one where you share extreme physical sensation until / after you find them ; if one of you hurts the other one hurts , if one of you is getting lucky the other one gets a little hot and bothered the one where the closer you are to them the more aware of them you become , and you find them playing a hot / cold game ; for instance , colors get brighter and brighter the closer you are and fade into gray when they ’re too far away the one where once you turn a certain age / one night a year you swap bodies with them for one night and you have a limited amount of time to leave / collect clues to their identity the one where being next to your soulmate(s ) can heal you from things people do n’t normally heal from the one where only your soulmate(s ) can kill you ( maybe you can still be killed by age / disease , maybe not , maybe you become vulnerable only after you lose your soulmate(s ) ) the one where reincarnation is also a thing and meeting your soulmate(s ) either unlocks or erases memories or your past lives until the next one the one where in universes with magic meeting your soulmate(s ) activates your powers / unlocks more powerful magic soulmate aus with complications : blind characters who ca n’t see if the world ’s in color or black and white characters like x - men ’s rogue who literally ca n’t touch people ; characters who have been through trauma who do n’t want to touch people hard of hearing characters like clint barton who ca n’t hear their soulmate speak without hearing aids / at all or on the flipside   characters who ca n’t speak ; maybe it still works in sign language , or maybe it does n’t people who ca n’t read / can’t read the language the words on their body are in characters like bucky barnes who ’ve lost hands and/or had their fingerprints removed soulmate clocks that time out in the middle of the crowd ; there ’s an entire craigslist category for finding who else was there that day with a clock that timed out too famous characters speaking to or performing for a crowd and suddenly their world is in color / their clock times out / etc and every member of the audience pretends to be this celebrity ’s soulmate and a cinderella type situation ensues with the finding soulmates playing the hot / cold game and they keep missing each other insomniacs who rarely sleep , much less at the same time / different time than their soulmates soulmate ot3s / ot4s / otmores where you dream in varying people ’s povs every time you sleep and get super confused people who get sick or injured and frantically search for their soulmates   so they can survive people who need to be in medically induced comas and their soulmates have to stay away so they do n’t accidentally wake them up the one where soulbonding is actually a choice and someone chooses to bond with someone they may not know or like to save their lives and have to figure out if they can unbond or if they have to live with the situation ( and of course learn to love one another either romantically or not ) new souls who do n’t get memories of past lives because they do n’t have one and panic muggles / people without powers who of course ca n’t get them upgraded or unlocked combination aus : the one where you one or both of you have to do all three ( see your soulmate(s ) , touch your soulmate(s ) , hear your soulmate(s ) ) , or all three have to happen at least once between the 2 + of you or it ’s completely random how you find your soulmate(s ) : one of you gets a name and the other gets a fingerprint , one of you has to hear your soulmate and one of you has to see them , etc ; particularly useful if you happen to be blind or deaf same for characters with other disabilities / who have “ complications ” : they get or find a different way of finding their soulmates , not better or worse , just different then there ’s soulmate aus that do n’t have to conform to lifelong monogamy : the ones where you have more than one romantic soulmate at the same time or you get a new soulmate after the first dies the ones where people have multiple soulmates of different types and it ’s color coded ; a red name / mark / etc for love , a blue one for friendship , etc ; for the ones where you start seeing color you get a new one for each soulmate the ones where some people have romantic soulmates and some do n’t , and those that do n’t are still perfectly happy anyway , maybe in a relationship anyway , maybe not the ones where some people have multiple romantic soulmates who may or may not also be soulmates with each other aromantic or asexual people who have soulmates who are not and they manage to work it out romantic and sexual people who do n’t have soulmates but find happiness anyway , either with someone like them or someone not like them soulmate aus that explore the ramifications of soulmates being a thing : the ones where soulmates are for everyone and get legal aid to help stay together , like if their in - laws try to keep them apart / someone risks getting deported / someone gets drafted / whatever the ones where soulmates are super super rare and technically get exempted from shitty things like “ people of different races / the same sex / etc ca n’t get married / have relations / etc ” but maybe still face a lot of prejudice and they fight to get those types of awful laws lifted for everyone agencies that exist to help you find your soulmate(s ) or   figure out which soulmate thing you have   but some of them are just shams , bonus points for this being in a verse where the thing is exceedingly rare to begin with people pretending to be soulmates to take advantage of the laws , for good or ill ; the couple who loves just as fiercely as a soulmates who will do anything to stay together , or the shitty people who try to claim they ’re mated to people who ’ve rejected them so they “ have ” to stay together tabloid mags photoshopping matching soulmate marks or following big legal cases where someone tries to prove or disprove that they are soulmates with someone else soulmates in universes where they ’re a rarity or rare soulmate types like ot3s / ot4s / otmores in dodging government officials because they do n’t want to become lab rats people who do n’t believe in soulmates until it happens to them , or people who believe hardcore and want to find theirs but they do n’t necessarily have one , or do n’t have a romantic one little rituals that make finding your soulmate more likely , like shaking hands with people as often as possible even with the cashier ringing up your groceries , repeating each other ’s names after you ’re introduced , etc just give me alllll the soulmate aus ok , give me people finding each other in spite of complications , give me all the delightful plot twists , give me detailed worlds where this changes the norms , give me it working out in the end whether romantically or not , bonded or not feel free to reblog with sources ! ( or more aus . ) a little over half of these are things i ’ve seen elsewhere over time and i can not remember where they are all from haha or if you ’re into this sorta thing    you could just take pity on me and reblog it anyway this took an embarrassingly long time to type up oh my god ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;                                                          \n",

” chat squints as he follows her gaze , and shakes his head when he ca n’t seem to make it out either . “ it should n’t be that dark . ”    “ it ’s not dark , exactly , but … ” she trails off , leaning forward slightly . her foot slips on the edge and she finds herself shooting forward , hands flailing and her yo - yo quickly unwinding before she can grab some of its slack .    chat shouts and launches himself after her . she feels his ribs crash against hers , the metal of his staff pressing between them as he pushes against it . he stumbles as he lands back on the edge , his arm gripped tightly across her waist . his breath fans across her face , hot and uneven , and he looks as if he ’ll be the next to topple off the edge . “ nice save , ” she says , frowning up at him . “ you okay ? ” “ i think i ’m too old for this , ” he wheezes . his grip loosens and he leans against her instead , shaking feeling back into his legs .    “ i think we ’re just out of practice . ” she presses a palm to his forehead , frowning more when she finds it burning up . “ and you ’re definitely not in the right shape for this . ”    “ i ’m fine . ” he grabs hold of her hand and squeezes it gently . “ getting over a nasty virus . overworked . stressed . i ’ll be good as new tomorrow . ”    “ well , that does n’t help me tonight , ” she says , squeezing his hand in return .    he presses another quick kiss to her knuckles . “ ah , your concern humbles me , my lady . but i think we have more pressing matters right meow . ”    she yanks her hand free . “ you ’d think after thirteen years , you ’d at least have better puns . ” “ what are you saying ? ” he raises in eyebrow in mock disbelief . “ my puns are ameowzing . ”    “ even worse , actually . ”    “ i ’m out of practice , ” he reminds her and leans against his staff . “ so , what do you think that shadowy area is ? ” “ i do n’t know . ” her gaze flicks back towards the dark patch in the horizon . “ it looks foggy , misshapen almost . definitely strange . ” “ so , let ’s investigate . ” he ’s already leaping past her , tail flying behind him , before she can register he ’s left . “ a warning would have been nice , ” she mutters . she flings her yo - yo at the building below , swinging after him .    the shadows do n’t clear as they near closer . their shape is just as distorted when they ’re up close , dark patches weaving in and out of focus .    “ i ’ve seen this before , ” she says slowly . she thinks of the shadows that edge her dreams sometimes , vaguely - shaped , always reaching .    chat pokes at the shadow with his staff . it passes straight through , even though the shadow is n’t transparent . “ it ’s all over this building , ” he observes . “ this whole row of buildings , actually . what did this used to be , an old business area ? ”    “ i ca n’t remember , ” she replies . “ it ’s been a while since i ’ve been home . i was too busy trying to keep afloat in new york . ” “ new york ? ” he seems surprised , chuckling as he retracts his staff and returns it to his side . “ what kind of heathen did they turn you into ? ”    she scoffs , flicking her yo - yo in his direction as she paces around the shadow surrounding them . “ certainly more refined than you turned out . you ’re barely more than skin and bones , you scrawny cat . ”    his smile fades . “ i ’ve been doing some traveling of my own . it did n’t turn out as well as yours . ” “ i can see that . ” she does n’t meet his gaze when he continues to stare down at her , the humor stripped from their banter , the shadows like dark clouds smothering their feet . they remind her entirely too much of her dream . “ we can go through it , i think . it does n’t seem harmful . ”    his hand stills her before she can test her theory . “ you do n’t know that . not all wounds are visible . ”    “ you have any other ideas ? ” “ not at the — ladybug , wait ! ”    but she ’s already passed through , the air stale and heavy around her . chat ’s voice is muffled behind her , as if there ’s a slate of glass between them . the building around her looks considerably more rotted than the outside ’s implied . the second floor is crumbling away , wooden support beams eroded and broken above her . there are streaks like burn marks across the walls . chunks of floor missing , dirt and rubble poking through . and the shadows hover like low - laying fog at her feet .    “ not impressed , ” chat says from behind her . he waves at the fog behind him , which seems to have risen to block out the city around them .    “ sorry for disappointing . ” she bends over to inspect a black streak winding down the decaying staircase . “ you said you ’ve seen this before , ” he points out . his steps are slow behind her . “ no . ” she runs a gloved finger across the blackened mark . she ’d expected soot to come free , but the blackness parts away from the stairs , drifting like smoke before dissipating . “ i mean , not exactly . ” “ it ’s like a dream , ” he says and the words startle her . she turns towards him , the grim line of his frown pulling at something familiar , something she ca n’t quite pinpoint . “ you ’ve dreamt this ? ” he lets out a low laugh and kicks at a piece of broken tile . “ since i was eighteen . same recurring dream , every night . ”    “ every night ? ” “ every night , ” he confirms . “ it ’s part of the reason why i was traveling . trying to find answers . ” “ did you see— ” “ a ghost ? ” he interrupts , standing stock - still as his eyes fix on something past her .    “ yes , exactly , ” she says . she feels her heart speed up , her blood both too warm and too cold in her fingers . “ no , ” he whispers , nodding slightly to what his gaze is fixed on . “ turn slowly and back up towards me . ” a shiver runs through her as she turns . his hand finds her , pulling her behind him , as she eyes the figure standing on the stairs . it ’s a woman , clad in a white pantsuit , her hair swept up neatly at the nape of her neck . but she ’s entirely transparent , made of nothing but white smoke that stands out starkly from the dark shadows surrounding her .    “ how do we fight ghosts ? ” he asks quietly , his staff held before him .    “ no idea , ” she replies , recalling tikki ’s words from earlier . her fingers edge towards her yo - yo , ready to use her lucky charm .    then , the woman screams , gray smoke pouring from her mouth as she dissolves before them , leaving the staircase bare again . both chat and ladybug jump back , shouting , but the shadows are already reeling away , fading into the walls .    there ’s something entirely too familiar about the woman , whose lectures marinette had n’t attended for many years .    “ was that … i mean , did you recognize her ? ” she asks . there ’s a beat of silence and she turns to look back at chat , who ’s swallowing visibly . “ i did , ” he finally says . his hand is still around her wrist and he lets go slowly . there ’s something both jarring and relieving to hear him confirming her fear .    “ so , is this something that mimics people ? imitates their shape , maybe ? should we be hunting down who they ’re targeting ? to ensure their safety ? ”    “ it could be , ” he says slowly , “ but miss bustier passed away a few years ago . ” she feels her blood run cold again . “ no , that ca n’t be . ” but she was younger than my mother . she reels back in her mind , trying to remember if someone had mentioned it to her . her parents . alya . maybe they ’d thought she ’d been too busy , maybe they ’d thought they ’d told her in passing — a skype or phone call before she ’d run off to chase after deadlines . maybe they had and she ’d buried it in the trenches of her memory , something to deal with later .    “ i had her one year . ” the words slide free , like an afterthought . it takes a moment for them to catch up to her and when they do , her eyes widen in panic . she clears her throat . “ i mean i— ”    “ i did , too , ” he replies . she glances up at him , but he ’s still staring at the staircase , lost in thought . he has n’t moved since the ghostly figure had disappeared .    “ we went to the same school , ” she says . the jarring sense tugs at her tighter . his head jerks toward her , eyes wide as he lets out a low chuckle . “ we really are out of practice , letting things like that slip . ”    she watches him run a hand through his hair , sending it tumbling past his eyes . she tries to recall someone tousling his hair similarly , but stops herself before she can fully dissect it . she ’d gone thirteen years without knowing his identity . she does n’t need to know now , not when there are more important matters .    “ how do we fight ghosts ? ” she repeats his earlier question . “ i do n’t know , but i have a feeling that wherever it ’s gone , it ’ll lead to the other ladybug and chat noir . ” “ practically a given , ” she agrees . “ the question is where . ”    a shrill beep sounds between them , startling more space between them .    “ time ’s running out , ” he says . “ should we come back ? ” she eyes the fog , almost entirely dissipated now . the decrepit building seems emptier around them now , as if whatever eeriness it held retreated with the shadows . it ’s nothing but forgotten debris now . “ i do n’t think we ’ll find any answers tonight . ”    her miraculous beeps a second time .    “ no , probably not . ” his eyes flick towards her , a smile at the edge of his lips . it has none of the fervor of his previous smiles . “ tomorrow ? ” “ unless you see something before then . ”    he bows , and the way his body seems to fold on itself makes the jarring even worse .    “ take care of yourself , ” she murmurs , barely catching the furrow of his brow as she tosses her yo - yo and takes flight again . does your boyfriend know you ’ve got a handsome partner fighting crime with you ? chat had said , collapsing his staff and returning it to his side . he cocked a grin in her direction .    she ’d immediately rolled her eyes . i do n’t think he has any competition .    me - ouch . he leaned against the wall , grin never faltering .    do you think your girlfriend would appreciate you flirting with another girl ? she ’d tossed back . this time , his grin did waver . it ’s just banter . you know i ’m not serious , right ? she ’d paused , arms folded across her chest as she took in his frown . his quips had come in less succession those days , less admiring , more vague .    if it ’s bothering you , i ’ll stop , he ’d continued . i ’m not trying to make you uncomfortable . it was strange , she thought , how the dynamic had changed between them , subtle only until they drew attention to it . how everything had to be drawn into boundaries , painted over in red lines . she ’d always had to ask herself would adrien be okay with this ? with this ? as if she could conjure him beside her and have him tell her how to act around chat . and then , she ’d wonder why she would have to examine it at all . do n’t worry about it , she ’d said , wishing more than anything her miraculous would call the night to an end . the way he looked at her made her feel anything but comfortable .</td>\n",

( months / years ) : if you want to be very technical , probably 13ish years . platforms you ’ve used : pencil and paper , forums , livejournal , aim , e - mail , skype , tumblr , telegram , discord . best experience :   eh , this feels a little unfair , but i really , really   love to write plotty shippy things , and so far my best experiences have been via e - mail with a longtime trusted friend . we wrote something like 21 different rps together in less than a year ( some as long as 300,000 words long … ) . we even rewrote one from the ground up when we decided we did n’t like the first one enough . and honestly ? it was so much fun . there ’s nothing at all wrong with being here for fun or attention , but i ’m here because writing is a lifelong passion of mine , and boy did it feel great to rp with someone who was as seriously invested in our rps as i was . plus , there was n’t that pressure that existed on tumblr of knowing people might be reading your thread and feeling your wording has to be perfect . heh . that said , so far this fandom has probably been my best tumblr rp experience , so that ’s good ! i ’ve met some great people here already . 4 . muse preferences female or male : i ’ve actually rp’d a pretty even 50/50 split , but i do prefer female muses . multi or single :   i ’m one of those tiresome old - school otpers who stand by the old definition of the phrase   “ one true pairing ” which is to say : i tend to ship one thing and stick to it . of course , according to rp rules and regulations i ’m multiship because you never know , and honestly gimme all the looker blogs i mean what haha i ’m not trash /sweats nervously 5 . writing preferences fluff , angst , or smut : all of the above , but i ’ll only write smut with someone i feel really comfortable with . that said , i like fluff and angst a whole lot , but they have to make sense and be in - character for me to enjoy them . sad shit for the sake of making the characters sad does n’t really fly with me .    plots or memes : plots , but i like memes , too , and sometimes they can grow plots and walk … long or short replies : honestly , both in the same thread is fine by me . it keeps the thread interesting / dynamic by letting things flow faster when they should be moving faster – kind of like writing a piece of fiction .    best time to write : this time of year i tend to get a lot done at work since my job is super busy in the spring / summer / fall and pretty dead in winter ; also , there are a lot of distractions at home sometimes . late at night is my worst time to write , though . i ’m pretty flexible work schedule wise , but i work an early shift so i ’m kind of a morning person these days . are you like your muse(s ) ? i ’m not much of a fan of this question , mostly because it ’s sort - of asking people to admit how much of themselves they ’ve sunk into their muse – something all writers do to an extent , but which most of us are n’t really willing to admit to doing , not in exacting detail , anyway . that said : yes . i am quite a bit like the version of anabel i ’ve chosen to portray , at least in terms of personality . looks - wise , anabel kicks my ass . i am , unfortunately , something like a gremlin . tagged by :    @sharplydressed - rockcollector tagging : @balsamina , @secret - agent - man - looker , @kahunacop , @moonkxssed .</td>\n",

” “ excuse me ? ” maeve walked alongside di josh derwent , praying that he would n’t say something that only he thought was clever . fat chance . “ you ’re with your people . ” he said it matter - of - factly and with a smirk . an annoying combination . if side - eye could kill , maeve should have arrested herself for murder right then and there . instead she took a deep breath and concentrated on following the person ahead of them , detective cassie maddox . but all the while , she could n’t help but think that derwent was n’t entirely wrong . it was just the way in which he said it , to get a reaction out of her , that was so irritating . she should n’t have been surprised though . the irish cracks had n’t stopped from the minute their plane landed .    the two london detectives were in dublin where they had been dispatched on special assignment . they were teaming up with the local murder squad on a case that had ties to one that they were currently investigating back in england . cassie led them down the hallway until they reached the main squad room . she quickly got everyone ’s attention and started a brief round of introductions . a less than enthused audience greeted maeve and derwent . when cassie finished and stepped aside to let derwent take the floor , he winked at her . “ thanks , sweetheart . ” cassie crossed her arms and offered him only a deadpan stare in return . she had already proven herself to be completely immune to derwent ’s special brand of charm from the moment they met . derwent marched to the center of the room while maeve silently repeated to herself : please do n’t embarrass me . please do n’t embarrass me . please do n’t embarrass me . so much for that . projecting his voice louder than necessary , derwent proceeded to give a rundown of his life ’s achievements . apparently , cassie forgot to include ‘ god ’s gift to mankind’ in her introduction of him . when derwent finished talking himself up , he began to bark out orders and managed to insult the entire dublin police department in the process . working for london ’s finest gave derwent a false sense of superiority . the met this and the met that … “ alright , no more dicking about . it ’s time to get some real work done . ” with that , he turned and briskly headed toward the exit , bumping hard into sam o'neill on the way out .   no acknowledgment and certainly no apology was given to sam . “ what a feckin’ gobshite , ” someone muttered as everyone returned to their usual tasks . cassie was suddenly feeling rather sympathetic toward maeve . “ is he always like that ? ” “ not always . but most of the time . ” she then added quite seriously , “ you ’ll have to forgive him . he was dropped on his head as a child . ” later , after a long day of poring over the case files , cassie and maeve decided to unwind at the local pub . they shared many laughs , mainly at derwent ’s expense . as the night wore on , their conversation turned quiet and contemplative when they commiserated over failed relationships . lesson learned : never sleep with colleagues named rob . both women downed their drinks simultaneously . maeve stared into her empty mug . “ i ’ll never make that mistake again . ” “ you ca n’t let one bad experience put you off . i did n’t . ” maeve turned to cassie . “ sam ? ” cassie ’s tiny smile turned into a full grin . “ i ’m impressed . you are a good detective . ” maeve had noticed the signs earlier . the affectionate teasing and meaningful glances shared when they thought no one else was looking . maeve could tell that sam had an underlying respect for cassie that quite frankly not many men possessed for women in their field . “ congratulations , he seems like a great guy . ” “ so you really would n’t consider another workplace romance ? ” “ i work with derwent , remember ? ” “ you never thought about– ? ” “ absolutely not ! ” that was a lie . but her one moment of weakness at ben and christine ’s wedding was pure stupidity . it did n’t count . and now maeve just desperately wanted to get off this subject . ” he ’s a rude cocky belligerent bastard and he drives me mad ! ” feeling a little guilty about her outburst , she managed to reluctantly add , “ but he is a good copper . ” “ he said the same about you . ” maeve ’s eyebrows went up . shocked was an understatement .   “ he did ? ” cassie nodded . “ while you were in the evidence room , he was bragging about all the tough cases you ’ve solved together . he said that you had all the tools to be a great detective but did n’t know what the fuck to do with them until he came along . now you ’re one of the best thanks to him . ” leave it to derwent to pay her a backhanded compliment . just then , maeve ’s phone chimed and she reached for it to read the incoming text . speak of the devil . where the fuck are you ! technically , it was n’t even a question but she had to answer . ignoring derwent was not an option . as she tapped her reply , maeve could n’t help but smile to herself . i ’m with my people . and for good measure , she added a smiley face emoji which was sure to have derwent seething . feeling happier than she had in quite awhile , maeve asked her new friend , “ how about another round ?

? ? or maybe . just maybe . that ’s a bullshit argument used to shut down enthusiasm for anything that is n’t heteronormative as well as to shame a group of what is perceived to be young women and girls . because any time young women like anything at all , however harmless or even positive and uplifting , that thing is relentlessly mocked and derided as shallow and ridiculous . this post has so much going on that i guess i got ta write a whole essay so here we go as a gay man , i can say with full and total confidence that more often than not , women ’s consumption of our relationships , and our sex lives , and our trauma is fetishistic . it ’s not about fighting heteronormativity . it ’s really not that deep . finding another man loving man in fandom is incredibly difficult , especially in shipping circles . i ’ve been in the tumblr business for almost seven years , and i ’ve met maybe 1 or 2 guys total who write slash besides me . slash fiction is dominated almost entirely by women and woman - aligned people , and it ’s been this way for a very long time . even a good amount of smutty slash fanzines in the 70s-90s were written by women who liked to write about boys fucking . when i met another guy who wrote slash fanfic , i was completely shocked . it had taken 6 or so years to meet him , and i was completely bowled over . and i just thought “ boys do n’t write about boys loving boys , that ’s not our thing ” . but what i wanna know is why is n’t it our thing ? ? ? why are n’t most slash fanfics written by boys who love boys ? why is n’t a genre , a subculture about us , something that we ’re seemingly not allowed to participate in ? why do we feel like outsiders when writing our own stories ? why are some of them most praised “ gay shows ” and “ gay books ” ( for example , the song of achilles and yuri on ice ) all written by women , and read by women , and are n’t really catered towards gay men at all even though we ’re the subjects of the story . when you go through websites like goodreads and look under the “ gay romance ” section , you see names like madeline , jane , abigail , marie , amy . i mean , abigail roux ’s writing alone probably takes up half the list ! you might see a sean or a david thrown in , but for the most part , stories about men loving each other are written by women . ones that are written by men often do n’t get the attention reigned in by the foxhole court and cut and run . that ’s where the issue lies . in a community supposedly dedicated to us , our love , our sex , our relationships , we take the back seat . we do n’t get recognition . we do n’t get control . we do n’t get to tell our stories our way . not to mention , much of slash has always been smut . and that smut , for a lot of questioning boys who love boys , that ’s our first exposure to sex between two men . i know it was for me . but when it ’s written by someone who ’s never been a man having sex with a man ( and no , if you ’re a cis girl having sex with a cis man is not the same way trans men have sex with cis men , but y'alls abysmal treatment of trans men will have to wait for another post ) , it ’s often written inaccurately and unsafely . not using a condom ? unsafe . spit as lube ? definitely not safe . shoving it in ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? really not safe . rimming someone without having them clean or use an enema first ? ? ? ? not only unsafe , but also really gross . the general consensus ( and yes i asked ) about this is that safe sex has been deemed by slash shippers to be “ boring ” . they want to get right to the fucking , no time for prep ( which is literally the most important part ) , no time for cleaning , no time for lube , no time for protection . this is incredibly dangerous for young men who love men who are trying to figure out all the different ways that we can make love to each other . if this is their only exposure , they ’re going to think that doing this is okay . they ’re going to think “ yeah , i can just shove my tongue into someone ’s dirty asshole ” or “ i do n’t have to prepare my partner before shoving very large into something very tiny ” which is not the case and will get people hurt . i know fic is n’t supposed to be a sex ed class , but the lack of sex safety is really concerning . and when men who love men like myself bring up the fact that maybe you guys should stay in your lane a little and let us take the wheel in a genre entirely dedicated to us having sex with each other , you somehow claim that we are “ kinkshaming ” you and being misogynist by taking away “ the one place where women can explore their kinks without judgement ” . which is complete and total bullshit because first of all gay people are not your kink . we are not your fetish , we do n’t exist for your entertainment or your gratification . if you really think that two men who make love to each other is your “ fetish ” , then maybe that ’s telling you something . human beings are n’t kinks . so fuck outta here with that . and the obsession with boys enduring homophobic and sometimes transphobic abuse and rape for the sake of ~angst~ and hurt / comfort is uh pretty fucked up . the obsession people have with gay trauma is by far the most disturbing of all . like so many woman slash writers go out of their way to subject gbt male characters to all sorts of injury and abuse just so they can be ~comforted~ and possibly get comfort sex . the idea that you want to see us hurt just because you think it ’s cute when we comfort each other is n’t okay . like , did n’t someone want to write a check please fanfic about the pulse shooting ? ? ? yeah how can any of you look at that and think it ’s okay . it ’s not okay . in no world is that okay . so this brings me to your claim that if gay / bi / pan men ( including trans men and male - aligned people ) tell you to maybe chill out and maybe let us write stories about us for a change , that ’s a misogynistic / homophobic / shallow statement . this just blows my mind . i need a little more clarification about why it ’s such an evil no - no for us to want to represent ourselves or speak for ourselves or tell our own stories . because it kinda seems homophobic that you ’re so angry about gbt men wanting to represent themselves . it almost sounds like you only think our love and our sex and our lives exist only for you to write and read about . you ’re making it sound like we are objects made for your consumption , and by establishing ourselves as real people is ruining your fantasy . nobody ’s saying you ca n’t be supportive of gbt boys and want to write about them in your stories . but for the love of god , do n’t get angry when we want to tell our own stories , and do n’t pitch a fit when we express that we ’re uncomfortable with being objectified for your own sexual gratification . tldlr ; men who love men have never existed for your consumption . we are not your “ escape from heteronormativity ” , we are not your “ safe space for kink exploration ” , we are not your favorite ships , we are not your kudos on ao3 . we are real men with real stories who want a chance to express ourselves in a genre that ’s about us but that we seemingly are n’t allowed into . we are people , and we deserve to and be seen as people and treated like people . stop speaking over us and invalidating our concerns about how we ’re being treated . and that ’s the tea . 🏳 ️‍ 🌈 💁 ‍ ♂ ️ ☕ ️ @ all you straight fujoshis oh my gods this . this is everything i try and fail to say when people ask me how to explain fetishization vs storytelling . do you know how many books by gay men i edited in my time at the erotica publishing house ? one . out of literal thousands of manuscripts , there was one gay man writing m / m , the rest were all by women , and i feel safe in saying , the majority of them , not from within the lgbtqa+ community . and boy howdy did they pitch fits when we turned to them and said “ your manuscript does not meet our health and safety requirements please revise ” because our house had a strict safe sane consensual rule , along with body positivity , which everyone loved when they were writing m / f stories . but when it came to m / m we had so many authors say “ ew , but that ’s not ~sexy~ :/ ” to which my reply was often a very politely phrased “ literally do n’t give a fuck susan , you know what else is n’t sexy ? bleeding assholes , which coincidentally is what you ’re being . ” but y'know , nicer . because i ’m a fucking proffesional . anyway . do you want to know what happened to said singular man writing m / m fiction ? he got dropped after a year . because , and i quote , this is a direct line from our then marketing team , about a gay man writing gay erotica : “ that ’s not what women want to read ” and if that ’s not one of the most precise and fucking infuriating demonstrations of what the fuck is wrong with the “ but i write gay slash fic ! i ca n’t be homophobic ! ” “ ~allies~ ” ( spoiler : you ’re not ) in fandom and yes , even in “ real ” publishing , i dunno what is . there is a difference between storytelling and fetishization , and all y' all crying “ kinkshaming ! ” when someone asks you to treat them with respect , need to stop . believe it or not , gay men do n’t own the concept of m / m . if you want m / m written by men , go over to nifty . fannish spaces like tumblr are predominantly female . we ’ll write whatever the fuck we want , thank you , and we wo n’t grovel to you for your permission . do n’t like it , block it . and it ’s really interesting to me how these anti - slash posts focus so intensely and so hatefully on women masturbating . like it ’s the nastiest thing in the world . oh , noes , women have sexual desires that do n’t take men ’s fee - fees into priority ! boo hoo . check yourself , assholes . could it be also that women do n’t want to read about other women because of empathizing too much with the women in the story ? maybe they want to feel safe and not have to read about women being tortured or hurt etc etc . maybe you do n’t know what it ’s like to be despised in fiction and fantasy . but i do . maybe you need a lesson in shuting the fuck up and listening .</td>\n",

       "      <td>3rdgymbros : magnus is turned into a child , and alex looks after him . posted on fanfiction.net and ao3 the trumpet of an angry elephant , audible even over the clatter of forks and knives scraping food off plates and a roomful of chattering einherjei , quickly causes a hush to fall over the vast crowd . all eyes fall onto a fuming alex fierro , who storms over to the table occupied by the floor nineteen , her eyes flashing . a quivering , child - sized bundle of pink trails along behind her , clutching onto a handful of alex ’s forrest green button - up shirt . “ all right , who the – ” alex , apparently remembering the child at her side , trails off in time and catches herself . “ who did it ? ” t.j trades a puzzled glance with mallory and half - born . “ did what ? ” “ who was the sorry sack of … of potatoes who messed with magnus ? ” alex asks , making sure to raise her voice so that everyone is able to hear her . “ sack of potatoes , ” halfborn mutters under his breath , letting out a bark of laughter that echoes in the ( mostly ) silent room . “ shut up , ” alex snaps testily in response . “ this is serious ! ” “ could you please explain what you meant by that last sentence ? ” half sarcastic and half serious , mallory props her chin up with her hand . “ who   did    what   to magnus ? ” t.j raises his hand , as though he ’s about to ask a teacher a question . “ and who ’s that lost child tagging along with you ? ” all eyes turn to said child , who whimpers unhappily at being the center of attention and buries a tousled head of blond hair into alex ’s side . it ’s not hard to see the unhappiness and discomfort that seem to take tangible space and form in the space around them . alex glares daggers at everyone staring , but speaks in a hushed whisper to the child at her hip , her tone soothing and light . taking the hint , the einherjei present hastily turn their gazes down onto their plates . “ that , ” alex says grimly , “ is magnus . he woke up like this . ” at the sound of his name , the lovely child raises his head . the boy is a toddler still , around five years of age . a soft , golden halo frames his round and cherubic face , with pale skin , apple - pink cheeks and full , upturned lips . the boy is dressed in a fuzzy pink sweater that slips off his shoulders and drags on the floor . it ’s enough to garner coos and sighs from the female ( and even some male ) einherjei . magnus latches onto her waist with his tiny but manacle - strong arms , inching his way behind her . halfborn ’s mouth drops open , revealing a half - chewed mouthful of bread . “ magnus ? that ’s   our   magnus ? ” grey eyes , the colour of pale dove feathers , peek out at halfborn from his place behind alex , right before magnus shakes his head frantically , and presses his face into alex ’s stomach . alex is quick to calm him down , holding him close as he burrows into her for comfort . “ how many other magnuses do you know in this place ? ” alex retorts in a quiet undertone , still keeping a protective arm around mini - magnus . magnus trembles in her arms . “ awex , ” he whimpers , the first thing he ’s said since they ’ve entered the dining room . her noxious bright green hair and generally dry sense of humour have not endeared her to children and adults alike ( not to mention her being transgender and gender fluid , which some particularly religious families have taken to mean that she ’ll be going to hell for her ‘ unnaturalness’ ) , but something warm and protective wells up in her chest at the sight of him clinging to her , trusting that she ’ll keep him safe from all the unfamiliar and possibly scary faces leering at him . and that ’s when alex knows that she ’ll fight and fight to keep this child –    magnus   – safe . “ well , there ’s a magnus down in brooklyn who throws the    best   parties – ” “ does it look like i care about magnus - in - brooklyn ? ” alex wants to scream . “ my –    our   – magnus is a child ! what are we going to    do ? ” an evil grin snakes it ’s way across mallory ’s face . “ my   magnus ? ” “ he ’s rather timid , ” t.j notes , interrupting alex’s - almost - meltdown . “ how come he ’s so attached to you ? ” despite the worry pooling in her belly , a rare grin lights up alex ’s face , and t.j thinks that it ’s easy to see why magnus ( the    older   magnus ) fell in love with her . “ magnus said my hair looked cool . and after i shape shifted a few times , he just … started following me around . ” “ like a duckling imprinting on the first thing it sees , ” mallory mutters under her breath , to which alex , with her eerily sharp hearing , says , “ shut up , keen . ” “ awex ? ” an unfamiliar voice , soft , and quaking with nerves , pipes up . “ awex angwy ?    who make awex angwy ? ” magnus looks around the room defiantly , squaring up his shoulders as though getting ready to fight with whatever – or whomever – is the cause of alex ’s distress . a gasp reverberates around the room . there ’s something strangely endearing about the blond child with a lisp , even as he butchers alex ’s name twice in four seconds . and alex – she does n’t seem remotely angry as she bends to meet magnus’ eyes . it ’s a miracle , t.j thinks , watching alex interact with mini - magnus . “ no , maggie , everything ’s okay . i ’m not angry , see ? ” she flashes him a quick smile , which magnus is quick to reciprocate with a shy upturn of his lips . “ angry people do n’t smile , right ? are    you    okay ? do you want something to eat ? ” “ ’m okay , ” magnus shakes his head when alex offers to get him food . still keeping his arms wrapped firmly around alex ’s denim - clad leg , magnus resumes hiding behind her , resting a soft , pale face against the small of her back . involuntarily , alex feels the blood rush to her cheeks . she hopes her face is n’t as red as it feels . magnus has always been cute , but as a child , the cute factor has been taken up several notches , and now comes in the form of the child at her back . “ you should go see blitzen and hearthstone , ” halfborn advises , once he stops guffawing at alex ’s pink cheeks . it earns him a surprised look of approval from mallory . “ this has ‘ magic’ written all over it . ” “ right , ” alex says , her voice saturated with relief . “ maybe hearthstone can reverse this spell . ” with difficulty , alex turns to address the child - sized bundle of pink behind her . “ c’mon magnus . let ’s go for a walk . did n’t you say you wanted chocolate ice cream ? ” she holds out her hand . nodding enthusiastically , magnus finally relinquishes his hold on her leg , clutching tightly at her long and slender fingers . it ’s like holding ice in her hand , alex thinks , a pang in her chest when she realises that magnus is so obviously scared by the strangers and the unfamiliar environment . but then magnus starts up a chant of , “ ice - cweam , ” and alex nearly wilts in relief , even more so when he graces her with a sunny smile . maybe this whole ‘ turning - turning - into - a - kid’ thing would n’t be so bad after all . magnus , alex learns , still has a love for falafel , even when he ’s regressed to the age of five years old . dressed in a blue button down shirt with jeans ( made and donated by    blitzen ’s best   ) and a pair of converse , magnus chomps happily on the plate of falafel in front of him , occasionally glancing up to beam at alex , who sits on the couch with hearthstone , a cup of hot tea balanced on her lap , sending warm spirals of smoke up into the air . blitzen tries to admonish magnus for getting food down the front of his new clothes , but his voice is closer to a coo than the normal gruff tone that would have come from a scolding . not even the dwarf is immune to magnus’ charms , it seems .      what do you mean you ca n’t turn him back to normal ?   alex signs out clumsily . she tries not to look too upset for magnus’ sake , all too aware of the piercing grey eyes on her back .    you have runes , you know magic , so why . . .      ca n’t . powerful magic .   hearthstone signs slowly , mostly for alex ’s benefit . magnus has been teaching her asl , but sometimes , his rapid - fire signing is hard to keep up with .    work of a god . should wear off in a few days . “ loki ? ”   alex demands , the name leaving a sour aftertaste in her mouth , as though she ’s swallowed a mouthful of curdled milk . hearthstone shakes his head .    no . looks like sjöfn ’s doing . “ sjöfn ? ” alex repeats the name slowly . “ i ’ve never heard of her . ” “ she ’s a minor love goddess , ” blitzen explains , wiping magnus’ face clean with a soft wash cloth . “ usually she ’ll stay out of mortal affairs , but every once in a while , there ’ll be a couple that she absolutely    has   to meddle with . ” he aims a sideways glance at alex . “ lucky all she did was turn magnus into a child . look at how romeo and juliet ended up . not to mention angelina jolie and brad pitt ! ” bet angelina and brad never turned into children . “ so all we have to do is wait ? ” alex asks . hearthstone nods .    spell is n’t permanent . magnus will be fine . besides , blitzen likes small magnus .    hearthstone points at blitzen , who is currently showing a wide - eyed magnus how he makes his best - selling chain mail high waisted skirt . alex bites back her smile .      “ there ’s an orphanage in the city with plenty of children for you two to adopt , ” alex remarks , forgetting to sign and bursts out laughing when hearthstone ’s cheeks flush – the elf might have been deaf , but he certainly was n’t inept at lip - reading . a few days have passed since their meeting with blitz and hearthstone , and magnus still has n’t turned back to normal . alex wonders if she should hunt sjöfn down , but she decides to give it a few more days . she ’d be doing the world a disservice by ridding the world of a mini - magnus , with his soft , pale skin , his tangle of bright blond hair , and his own sweet smell , like apples in a bowl . in a surprisingly short amount of time , magnus has managed to worm his way into the hearts of all the einherjei at hotel valhalla . sam supplied him daily with amir ’s falafel and flying sessions , halfborn gunderson had knitted magnus an assortment of stuffed toys and child - sized   blankets , mallory keen was teaching him gaelic , and t.j played war games with him . even jack had taken magnus for a karaoke session with his friends from hotel valhalla ’s weapons vault . “ you ’re staring , ” sam notes . a young girl , around the age of twelve , had strolled past with a herd of her friends , only to see magnus , and immediately stopped to pick him up for a kiss and a cuddle . the girl giggles with her friends in a way that sets alex ’s teeth on edge . magnus’ dimples flash as he gifts the cooing girls with a shy smile that they are quick to gush over . even though it ’s not directed at her , alex feels the tense set to her shoulders relax . her soul smiles . alex scoffs , her tone sharp and biting . “ am not . ” she keeps a careful eye on magnus , ready to pluck him from the harpy ’s arms if magnus seems the least bit uncomfortable . sam smiles knowingly . “ jealous ? ” “ hardly . ” sam eyes her sister skeptically . “ uh - huh . that would explain why you look like you want to take your garotte and wrap it around emily ’s throat . ” “ is that her name ? ” alex asks innocently , making a mental note to find her in combat later that afternoon . sam ’s only response is to roll her eyes . he ’d originally been content to be passed around from girl to girl , but as soon as he catches sight of alex , standing a little way off with sam , he kicks and struggles , eliciting a shocked squeal from the red - head holding onto him . alex is quick to shoot a nasty glare at the girl , promising death by clay cutter if magnus is n’t let down immediately . his failing arms and legs nearly give the girl a black eye , and she unwillingly sets magnus on his feet . “ awex ! ” magnus squeals , running over as fast as his short , chubby five - year old legs can manage . he holds onto her as though he has suction cups on his arms . “ awex ! ” she ’s grown used to being called ‘ awex’ , but there is nothing like the unadulterated joy of a child calling your name . alex is liberal with her smiles when magnus is involved . she gives him one . sam muffles her laughter with the palm of her hand . alex ignores her , and bends to ruffle magnus’ hair . “ hey , maggie , ” she says , right before the life is squeezed out of her in the form of magnus throwing his arms enthusiastically around her neck . “ having fun ? ” “ yeah ! ” he says , eyes bright and sparkling . “ jack can talk ! an’ we went to awt class ! jack ’s    weaw   good at sewing ! ” “ so i ’ve noticed , ” alex mutters , recalling the bowling bag that jack had worked on with blitzen . jack had regaled them with tales about how he and frey had won numerous awards for their sewing , something that alex would have been very happy not knowing . in a slightly louder voice , she asks , “ so what ’d you make , maggie ? ” “ dis ! ” proudly , magnus holds up a misshapen clay heart , crafted with clumsy , fumbling hands , painted a bright shade of red . “ jack hewped . ” he intones solemnly , pointing at the ‘ alex’ scratched into the surface of the clay before he presses it into alex ’s hands with a shy smile . he looks hopefully at alex , his eyes full of childish innocence and pride . “ awex happy ? ” ( unbeknownst to magnus and alex , sam slips away unnoticed . ) alex resists the urge to tear up , swallowing past the waterworks lump in her throat . her old home may have been filled with all the material goods she could ever want , but if anything , it lacks the charm of her new suite at hotel valhalla . all the gadgets and money in the world , and she ’d trade them all away , without a second thought , for a handmade present from the person she ’s fond of . willing her voice not to crack , alex says slowly , “ i love it . ” and magnus    beams . deep into the wee hours of the night , alex hears the door to her room creak open . she ’s always been a light sleeper , and crunch of footsteps on grass , quiet though they might be , along with snotty sniffles is enough to rouse her from her slumber . alex props herself up on one shoulder , her fingers already inching their way towards the golden wire under her pillow . “ who ’s there ? ” her only response is a teary whimper , one that she could have picked out from a crowd of thousands . quick to flick on her bedside lamp , alex blinks as the sudden light blinds her . “ magnus ? ” she calls , swinging her legs over the side of her bed . “ magnus ? ” her anxiety skyrockets when he does n’t answer ; if anything , the sound of her voice causes magnus to dissolve into more heart - wrenching sobs that feel like a stab in the gut every time . “ where are you ? ” on slightly shaky legs , alex throws back her duvet and slips out of bed , the mattress springs creaking . she makes a beeline for her living room , but a tug at the edge of her shorts stops her . it ’s magnus . his face is flushed . tears clump his normally pale eyelashes together , making them dark . magnus rubs his tears off his cheeks with the sleeve of his pyjamas . alex used to do that too , before she stopped crying altogether . “ magnus ? ” she swipes at his tears with harried , clumsy fingers , giving magnus a quick - once over to ensure he ’s unhurt ( he is ) . she is n’t good at this sort of thing – comforting people , or picking tender words out of midair . but alex tries . “ what ’s wrong ? ” a tear runs down magnus’ cheek . he shakes his head , clamping his lips firmly together . alex takes him by both shoulders and looks him in the face . “ please tell me what ’s wrong . i wo n’t be mad , i promise . ” “ i wanna go home ! ” the words burst out of magnus in a loud torrent , and he dissolves into tears once again . “ i ’ve wooked and wooked , but i can’ find mommy ! ” magnus buries his face in her neck and sobs loudly . alex strokes her hands down magnus’ back , patting and whispering that it ’s okay . she holds magnus and breathes in the smell of his skin , feels the tears falling hot on her skin . inwardly , she ’s spitting out curses in every language she knows . this is what comes of trying to keep things from magnus . this is what happens when , in all the excitement , they forget that magnus is young , and scared , in an unfamiliar place with no familiar faces . this precious child , hurting . “ i ’m so sorry , magnus , ” alex murmurs , as the sobs quiet and magnus begins to draw in long hitching breaths . “ you must have been scared . ” magnus rubs the tear trails from his face with his hand . “ i wike awex , but i wanna see mommy , and annabeth . ” she has no idea who annabeth is , only that magnus is obviously attached to her . an aunt or a cousin maybe ? alex makes a mental note to ask magnus when he turns back into an adult . “ i know , and i ’m sorry , but you ca n’t see them just yet . ” alex tries to evade . “ i ’ll see if i can call them to pick you up , okay ? ” liar , liar , pants on fire . magnus sniffs . his upper lip is caked with snot and his cheeks are streaked with saltwater tracks . “ when ’s mommy coming ? ” how can she tell him that his mother is dead ? ( she does n’t . ) “ soon , ” alex promises , guilt constricting her trachea . “ soon . she ’ll be here in the morning , i promise . ” she scoops him up . “ let ’s get you back to your room . ” “ can i stay ? ” magnus’ voice trembles . his expression punches alex in the gut . he expects rejection . “ pwease ? ” “ ’course , ” alex quickly reassures him , tucking the blankets around both magnus and herself in one smooth motion . alex turns out the light and crawls back into her cocoon of still - warm covers with a sigh . magnus curls up in her arms , pushing , squirming and kicking until he ’s comfortable , touching as much of alex as possible . alex is sure her skin will be dotted with bruises when she wakes up tomorrow . she ’s almost asleep again when magnus says , “ i wuv you awex . ” not something she ’s anticipated hearing . in her startle , alex nearly falls out of bed . she opens and closes her mouth soundlessly , and manages a quiet ,    “ what ? ” “ i wuv you , awex , ” magnus says again , all traces of tears gone . “ and i’w mawwy you when i gwow up . ” a hot flush steals across her cheeks ; she ’s glad for the cover of darkness , where no one can see her blush . “ well , then , ” alex says at last , “ you ’ll have to get me a ring . ” “ ’kay , ” alex can hear the smile in magnus’ voice . his blond head of hair tickles the crook of her arm and his breathing evens out . “ night - night . ” “ ’night , magnus , ” alex murmurs quietly in response , right before her own eyes flutter shut . “ mallory , this is a bad idea , ” t.j whispers behind her . mallory nearly drops her phone . her last picture - a shot of alex pressing her cheek against magnus’ bare chest - is a little blurry , but it ’s nothing a little editing ca n’t fix . she shoots him a glare over a freckled shoulder . “ idiot ! you scared me ! ” “ alex is n’t going to be happy about those pictures . ” “ she 's    never   happy , unless she ’s with magnus . and there ’s no way i ’m passing this chance up . ” “ make it quick . ” t.j shooes her . “ fine ! ” exasperated , mallory shoves her phone into her pocket . “ let ’s get out of here . ” “ should n’t we wake them up ? ” t.j nods at the intertwined couple before he closes the door with a soft snick . “ nope , ” mallory ’s smile is as devious as loki ’s . “ they ’ll find out … eventually . ” t.j and mallory sneak back down the hallway , but they ’ve barely made it five feet when a loud scream resonates from the room they ’ve just left . mallory doubles over with silent laughter , leaning on t.j for support . “ what the – why in the name of the gods are you naked ! ? ” “ please tell me we did n’t have sex –    ow , alex ,    stop   – ” “ get out ! ”</td>\n",

( i thinks it ’s relevant that ao3 was designed by fandom ’s lj generation and in some respect mirrors the affordances of lj circa 2010 . tumblr is a very different site and that , moreso than age differences , seems to be at the root of this – though of course age intersect with site experience in a non - trivial way . ) ding ding ding ding . ao3 requires you to police your own consumption of content .    ao3 wo n’t let you destroy someone ’s online presence simply because you do n’t like it .    ao3 wo n’t let you impose your own morality on other without cause . if you have issues with this , and the fact that ao3 requires you to have responsibility and agency ,    then you seriously need to sit down and have a damned good long hard look at yourself . the question i usually fail to see being answered when people bitch about the content on ao3 is - so who gets to decide ? you ? me ? a committee of my friends ? of yours ? of those who have the most kudos ? of those who have no interest in fandom , but want to protect other people from dangerous content , whatever it may be ? who gets that power , and how long will they have it ? who are you comfortable with giving the power of regulating all the content ? what happens in grey areas ? what happens when something you like is n’t liked by the decider ? is there an appeal ? who gets to make the arguments for and against something ? the world is complex and there are no easy answers . the impossibility of creating a censorship board that curates based on content is a great reason why those things do n’t exist , and should n’t . certain people are screaming that ao3 is bad because it ’s not a   “ safe space . ” the real problem they have , though , is that ao3 was created to be a safe space - for writers . and it does a pretty good job of that .    it was designed to be a place where writers are safe from arbitrary content rule changes , random and unwarned deletions , and abuse - report abuse ( which is common on ff.net ) . the four big warnings + cntw system is beautiful in its fairness and simplicity . antis ca n’t take control of it . and because control - freakdom is at the heart of their   “ movement , ” this drives them into frenzies . good . it motivated me to dig a little deeper into my pocket to donate on the last drive . for all the pleasure ao3 has given me over the years , that ’s money well spent . the real problem they have , though , is that ao3 was created to be a safe space - for writers .        preach it loud and hard ! i ’m a member of the lj generation , and when i first came to tumblr ( grudgingly and out of desperation , i might add , since it tragically seems to be the only place to really connect with other fandom peeps ) i was horrified at how people here had established this sort of fucked up bully culture , where nobody is responsible for monitoring their own consumption , and rather they expect everyone else to custom tailor content to the whims and desires of the shrieking banshee masses . and woe be to the person who does n’t bend and break ! “ i ’m going to bully you while accusing you and your big mean poopie content of being the actual bully , so i can hopefully distract you and others from realizing i ’m being a royal intrusive asshat who failed astronomy 101 b / c i clearly believe the world revolves around me . ” the irony here is that this in itself is an abuse tactic - victim blaming with a side of gaslighting . pot , meet kettle . and it ’s the exact same mentality that drives right - wing lunatics to kick up a fuss about the existence of icky cootie gay people in media because we need to “ protect family values ” , or who take to screeching at starbucks because their particular religious symbolism is n’t portrayed on the winter holiday cups and omg war on christmas , starbucks stop oppressing me by not catering to my personal taste . the mentality is one and the same - “ cater to me me me or face my divine wrath even if it means taking away other people ’s freedom ! ” while hiding behind a flimsy - ass shield of faux righteous anger .      and when these bozos find an environment or situation where they ’re unable or not allowed to bully people into silence and submission , they stomp their feet and pitch a tantrum and claim that they ’re the ones being oppressed . identical shit , different pile , and it ’s the exact same infantile , schoolyard rubbish no matter which side it ’s coming from . this was a really interesting read . the last poster in particular but all of it . ao3 was literally created to give fan creators a place where they would never be controlled by the whims of those using the so - called protection of the vulnerable as their excuse for bullshit control and attack tactics . when i first saw this post i wanted to scream . because you know what ? a lot of shit on ao3 is in fact evil . its fine and fair to say that people should curate their own content and choices . but i ca n’t imagine i am the only person who was as disastrously unlucky enough to stumble upon any of the most unapologetic pedophilia . or other just as vile untagged fuckery . it was a violent and distressing experience for me , and sure folks like you might think that s my own damn fault . whatever . that s not why i set out to discuss or add here .   because turns out ao3 does have an abuse reporting feature . if its any use , who knows . i do nt . but people should know it exists . i ca n’t speak to ao3′s priorities . perhaps its not there to remove disgraceful content . perhaps they only care about rude reviews and shit comments . whatever . i ’m done with this post and anyone who believes you ’re a crybaby who needs catering to when you want to see abusive content removed . the fuck is the ‘ lj generation’ like y all rly think ur wise elders who need to teach these bad mean children about censorship 🙄 🙄 y all rly acting like lgbt people , people of color and rape survivors are petulant children even when some of these “ antis ” are probably twice yalls age but that does nt fit the narrative that ur the rational logical adults fighting against rabid kids who want to censor ur “ ” “ art ” “ ” but keep thinking ur fighting the good fight by maintaining a safe space for pedophiles , racists , and abusers 😂 i would rather never see a single piece of fannish content ever created again than knowingly provide sanctuary to dangerous evil people and those who would protect them but y all think it would be too hard to have any kind of decency standards so lets just not bother at all . by that argument why have laws ? why have society at all ? after all its complicated to decide what is right and wrong and what rules we should have , so why even try in the first place ! because that totally makes sense 🙃 🙃 🙃 a good portion of the lj generation were pissed off because the new rules included no pornographic depictions of characters under the age of majority , or who were under the age of majority for a large portion of their franchise — that ’s iirc .   it ’s been awhile .      anyway , there was literally   pedophilic content rampant within lj comms and there was no censoring and no attempt by fandom elders to hide content from preteens — which i know , because i never hid or lied about my age to an actual person .      at most , some folks expressed discomfort when i stated my age , and once someone asked me to unfriend / unfollow them because i was younger than their son and they were seriously bothered .   other than that ?   not a peep .         ao3 does n’t care if a pedophile posts work fetishizing a teacher sexually abusing his preschool students even tho that ’s literally child pornography . and illegal as fuck . they ’re hosting some pretty evil shit , and acting like they should n’t be held even slightly accountable is really irresponsible . there is a middle ground between complete censorship and letting users post child porn on their site . i think you ’ve got your terminology mixed up . ( upfront disclaimer : i ’m from the us , so i ’m working with the us legal definition , other countries may differ . additionally , ao3 is us based , so that is the law system that is relevant to the discussion of the site . ) child pornography :   any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor ( someone under 18 years of age ) .   visual depictions include photographs , videos , digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor , and images created , adapted , or modified , but appear to depict an identifiable , actual minor . ( x ) so , if the example you mentioned is written , it categorically does not count . if the example you mentioned is fictional art , it categorically does not count . if either of the above two are true , it is therefore not   ‘ illegal as fuck’ although it may appear on a morality scale anywhere from gross or not - in - good - taste to disgusting trash or not - enough - brain - bleach - in - the - world . but that is personal opinion and not actually a legal matter . on the other hand , if ao3 is honestly hosting actual child porn somewhere on the site , then report it , because that is not allowed ( x ) . neither , for that matter is abuse of the rating system ( tagging something as g or t when it should be m or e ) or archive warnings ( not tagging   ‘ choose not to warn’ or any of the other archive warnings when they do in fact apply ) ( x ) . as to responsibility , they are doing nothing illegal . they are being as responsible ,   as any other free similar - content site on the web , if not more so . also :      we are also lgbtq / queer , rape / sexual assault survivors , abuse survivors , mentally ill , disabled , etc . you do not get to fucking claim those categories as if you speak for us . you do not get to set the standard for those identities .      as someone who was on fucking lj at the time , you know who was the most terrified , the most violated , by strikethrough ? survivors .    survivor ’s comms .   survivors who rped . survivors who had support groups .      queer writers . like me . because warriors for innocence - the right - wing dominionist xtian group behind it - used   “ child pornography ” as their smoke - screen but fucking trust me , we knew they were coming for us .      teenage writers like i had been ( i started on lj at 16 and was in my very early 20s for strikethru ) , who were fucking tired of pretending that because we were 17 instead of 18 ( or 19 or whatever magical number - divorced , often , even from actual legal age of majority - it was that someone felt we needed to have passed ) we needed to be ~*protected from all discussion of sex evar*~ and in fact cherished , valued and were well - served by adults who had a damn clue . who gave us space to engage with fiction   for one of the best opportunities that fiction offers : that of messing around and working through all kinds of experiences and emotions without having to live or re - experience them in the flesh .      you do not get to frame this as a righteous battle between poor vulnerable survivors , queers / lgbtq , teenagers , etc , and mean privileged people , because we are also fucking part of those categories .   we are survivors , we are queer , we are mentally ill . the people you are attacking include poc , they include trans people , they include survivors of childhood abuse , they include survivors of incest . stop trying to act like they do n’t .      and , as i know i have talked about previously , you also do n’t get to demand that everyone who works with darker fiction for this shit clearly disclose to you their status . you have no right , no right , to demand that people bare their souls to you in order to determine whether their fiction   is allowed to exist .      these are not your hot - button to hit to make everyone else shut up . you do not get to say   “ i ’m x - group so what i say goes . ” we are too .        “ but y all think it would be too hard to have any kind of decency standards so lets just not bother at all . by that argument why have laws ? why have society at all ? “ yeah no . a tagging system like the one ao3 has   is literally a set of standards .      besides which , ao3 is not a government . ao3 does not set the rules for what fanfic gets to exist . it ’s a fucking website . if you do n’t like their standards , do n’t use their website . make your own website where whatever thing you dislike is forbidden . meanwhile , as everyone else has said , quit pretending you ’re in a moral crusade against evil people who write bad things .      because honestly , among any number of other good reasons , insinuations that i ’m evil because i write bad things ? is fucking triggering . i ’m sort of amazed that there ’s a contingent of people that are actually calling for censorship on a free fanfic site . slippery slope .        i followed this post for some time now and what i really do n’t get , where are all this untagged evil fics on ao3 ? i ’ve been on that archive since its start and also an lj veteran . i am active in multiple fandoms and certainly not shying away from m - rated fics . but in over 15 years of reading fanfiction online ( not even in lj - times ) have i come across what they are describing . imho you must have to really dig for examples because otherwise - statistically speaking - i should come across those fics regularly . and it never happens … so , i smell troll in the dungeon “ ur the rational logical adults fighting against rabid kids who want to censor ur “ ” “ art ” “ ” yep .   ",
       " \" ur fighting the good fight by maintaining a safe space for pedophiles , racists , and abusers 😂 ” yep ! because if the free expression of the guy you hate is n’t protected * , then neither is yours . that ’s how it works . and you know who does n’t like ( or if i ’m being charitable , who does n’t understand ) that ? fascists , nazis , totalitarians , and “ rabid kids who want to censor ur ” “ \" art ” “ ” . way to pick your bedfellows . * ao3 , as a non - governmental operation obviously has no legal obligation to protect or enable any kind of expression at all : it is merely to their obvious and great credit that they do .</td>\n",

” he asked , reaching for the plates to help clean up . “ usually . lunch is the only somewhat calm meal . ” yuuri stretched with a deep sigh . “ i need a nap before then . ” “ kits keep you up ? ” “ no , viktor , ” he replied dryly , pausing before he continued and flushing a bit as he obviously changed his mind . “ so what do you have planned for the day ? ” guang - hong shrugged . “ unpack maybe . is there anything you need help with ? ” “ mmm , there ’s still enough leftovers from the feast to take care of lunch for today . the kits are tending the gardens and picking vegetables for dinner later . ” yuuri set the last of the dishes in the basin and filled it with water . “ i can ask around and see if anyone needs a hand if you ’d like . ” “ sure . thanks . ” at least he was making progress . his chat with chris had left him feeling lighter and ready to face the challenge of making this his home . “ have a nice nap . ” he grabbed a glass of tea to take back with him , glancing at his trunks and taking a deep breath . he could do this . it would n’t take that long if he did n’t get distracted . he started with his clothes , sorting and folding them to put in the dresser . the empty trunks went into the closet . he found his knife tucked away in the third trunk and slipped it under his pillow , glancing to the window to make sure no one was watching . he finished emptying one trunk of books and was half done with the second when there was a knock on his door . he stuck his head out the window to see chris with a small tray . “ i get the feeling you ’re all trying to fatten me up for slaughter . ” chris laughed , moving to the window to hand over the tray . “ slaughter would be the last thing on my mind , ” he said with a wink . guang - hong blinked , his mind trying to wrap itself around the notion of chris flirting with him . “ what are you doing all holed up in here ? ” “ uh … unpacking , ” he said , ignoring the flush of heat in his cheeks as he eyed the bowl of peaches with a large glob of cream . he dipped his finger in it before licking it clean . that was delicious - fresh and slightly sweet . he scooped up more , glancing up with a smile only to find chris staring at him as he sucked his finger clean . he felt his face go scarlet , pulling his finger out of his mouth and turning for the door so he could compose himself . just breathe . it was n’t like he had n’t been hit on before , he just was never in a position to return the sentiment even if he ’d wanted to . once he ’d been … involved in his father ’s work , what interest he ’d had in getting attached to anyone who could get hurt because of him vanished entirely . he banged his forehead against the wall a couple times before pulling the door open . “ really though . what ’s with all the food ? ” chris raised an eyebrow as he stepped inside . “ if you stopped missing meals , yuuri would n’t worry so much . ” guang - hong wrinkled his nose and dipped a slice of peach in the cream before popping it in his mouth . he had n’t missed that many … just dinners … and breakfast . “ sorry . ” chris waved a hand . “ so long as you ’re adjusting . you need help unpacking ? ” “ i ’m almost done i think . ” just his books and the trunk with his few pictures and treasures he had n’t been able to leave behind were left . he dropped down on the large chair , crossing his legs as he worked through the rest of the peaches . “ is there anything i can help with ? what is it you do ? ” “ me ? ” chris shrugged . “ a lot of odds and ends , help keep the peace , unofficial record keeper . ” “ that sounds difficult . ” “ not too bad until yurio decides to pick a bone with someone , ” chris said dryly . guang - hong snickered , resisting the urge to swipe up the last of the cream with his finger and setting the bowl on the table instead . “ i might go wander . i have n’t really seen much outside of the tour . yuri said there ’s a shrine ? ” “ to inari , yeah . there ’s a small path that leads to it near the barn . careful you do n’t get lost , or touch anything . yurio’ll get cranky if you do . ” “ speaking from experience ? ” chris grinned . “ maybe . he used to need weekly reminders that his attitude sucked . he ’s calmed a lot these past couple years . ” guang - hong was n’t sure he wanted to know what yuri used to be like if he was “ calm ” now . chris reached for the bowl , using his own finger to dip up what was left of the cream and licking it off with a wink . “ go wander . fresh air should do you good , ” he said , standing and heading to the door with a decidedly teasing flick of his tail . “ yell if you need anything . ” “ thanks … . ” he breathed a soft sigh once the door closed behind chris , rubbing at his face . what the hell was that ? air . he definitely needed fresh air . he pulled his boots on and headed out , thankful for the breeze as he stuck to the shade as much as possible . the barn was easy enough to find and he took a few minutes watching the animals . there were way more than he ’d originally seen - chickens , sheep , goats … he even spied some rabbits , but they seemed to be wild . a large grey wolf - dog dozed near the sheep , the flicking ears betraying its alertness . he pushed away from the fence , walking around the barn until he found the path to the shrine . only a dozen steps brought him into the thick of the forest , the path winding between trees , parts of it obscured by bushes and flowers he ’d never seen before . when he came to a fork , he stopped , cursing under his breath . chris had n’t mentioned having to choose a direction . did that mean he was lost ? fantastic . he closed his eyes and refrained from turning around in case he lost what direction he ’d come from . he steadied his breathing until his heartbeat was n’t pounding in his ears , focusing on the music of the forest instead - the wind - rustle of the leaves , the droning cicadas , the staggered trills of songbirds . beneath it he could just make out the sound of water , but he could n’t focus on it with the sound of … singing overshadowing it . he turned towards the singing , following it around a bend and stopping as he found leo in front of an injured deer , a couple of spotted fawns next to him . one of them had its hooves on his back as it chewed at his hair . guang - hong stifled a laugh of surprise behind his hand , unable to believe the sight . he ducked behind a large bush , unwilling to make his presence known , both in case it startled the animals and because he was sure leo ’s mood would turn sour . leo tended to the doe ’s injured leg as he continued singing , though he did n’t understand the words . the lilt sounded like an upbeat song despite the somber tone of his voice . he had a good singing voice , and he actually looked … kind of cute when he was n’t scowling , and why the hell was he thinking that ? chris had to be getting to him . it was n’t like seeing leo being kind changed the fact he was a jerk . he bit his lip as he realized he was spying , taking a step back and wincing as a twig snapped beneath his foot . he froze as the deer startled . crap . if leo wanted to kill him , now would be the most opportune time . he tensed as leo looked up , putting himself in front of the injured animal and drawing a long knife from the sheath on his thigh . the sight of the weapon triggered his trained instincts enough he was reaching for his own weapon that was n’t there before he could stop himself , his trainer ’s words echoing through his head : leave no witnesses . leo was n’t a witness . this was n’t a job and he was n’t in any danger . he hoped . he swallowed as leo looked at the bush he was hiding behind for several heartbeats before finally turning back , sheathing his weapon . “ that ’s all i can do . stay away from the thicket from now on , yeah ? ” leo snorted as the deer butted her head against him before turning , her fawns trotting after her . guang - hong held his breath as leo picked up the supplies , wondering if he should run for it or just stay still and hope for the best . “ i really hope you do n’t think you ’re hidden . ” shit . he winced as leo stood and walked right towards him . “ i was n’t spying … . ” he said , stepping out from behind the bush . “ right . ” guang - hong made a face before taking a breath , refusing to let leo get to him . “ i was looking for the shrine and … followed your voice when i heard you singing . it was good . ” leo eyed him in surprise , looking away with a faint flush and hefting his bag . “ … the shrine is this way . ” he turned and started back towards the other fork in the path . apparently his mother was right , a little kindness went a long way . he smirked and followed after . “ you ’re good with animals . ” “ i guess . ” guang - hong hummed and took the chance to look for any landmarks or defining markers , though all he could make out was green , green , and more green , sometimes interrupted by large , bright flowers . “ how do you not get lost out here ? ” leo glanced back at him with a twitch of his ears . “ how do you not get lost in your cities ? ” guang - hong tilted his head , biting his tongue against the urge to say they had roads and signs . it was n’t like he looked at the signs half the time anyway . “ the buildings all look different . they act as landmarks . ” “ so do the trees . ” leo slowed a minute later near a tree larger than the others in the area , it ’s branches extending up and out further than he could see . the sound of water grew louder the closer they got . “ shrine is he- ” he started , stopping and looking around as his ears twitched . he took off around the tree with a curse . guang - hong hurried after , the shrine coming into view on the other side , tucked into a hole carved into the massive trunk . the source of the water came from a spring that welled up under the carving of a fox with nine tails and turned into a deep pool beneath the tree ’s roots . yuri was hunched over near where the path ended , one arm pressed against his stomach . he looked up when leo dropped down next to him , slapping his hand away . “ i ’m fine . just something i ate . ” he stood up with a grimace . “ why are you two here ? ” “ i just wanted to explore the village … are you sure you ’re okay ? ” yuri brushed back the strands of hair that had fallen free from his weave . “ i ’m fine . ” “ you ’re pale , ” leo said . yuri glared . “ i ’m fine , ” he said , turning towards the shrine . he swayed to the side as he walked . he and leo both rushed forward , grabbing yuri ’s arms as he lost his balance . “ you ’re not fine . you should rest . ” yuri growled and tried to get away from their hold before nearly collapsing again with a soft moan . “ maybe . ” guang - hong glanced at leo over yuri ’s head . “ should we carry him ? ” leo slanted an annoyed look at him , though he could see the concern beneath it . he handed his pack over before scooping yuri up in his arms . “ keep up . ” guang - hong caught the pack and broke into a run just to keep up with leo ’s quick strides . the overhanging leaves and branches seemed to pull away from their path despite them cutting through the thick of the forest . when the forest finally gave way to the village , he slowed to catch his breath . several of the others were gathered near the dining area and leo continued on ahead , the others crowding around him and yuri as he reached them . he drew up to them a couple minutes later , setting leo ’s bag on the end of the table . seung - gil crouched in front of yuri , speaking with him in quiet tones . “ guang - hong , good to see you again . ” guang - hong tensed and turned to see phichit walking towards them , wearing a gold and red yukata that strangely suited him . “ phichit … . ” phichit smiled , patting him on the shoulder as he passed , pausing as he looked at yuri and seung - gil . “ yuri . congratulations . ” yuri looked up in annoyance . “ screw you , too . ” seung - gil looked at phichit a moment before turning back to yuri . “ he ’s saying you ’re pregnant . ” “ i ’m what ? ! ” “ he ’s what ? ” guang - hong winced at the loud chorus of disbelief . yuri was … pregnant ? he supposed he ’d known subconsciously it was possible considering yuuri and viktor had children who looked exactly like them , but the concept of a male giving birth was a bit to really wrap his mind around . “ yurio , when did you get yourself a mate ? ” viktor asked , patting yuri on the back . “ i did n’t , ” yuri snapped , shifting to slap at viktor ’s hand . “ of course you did ! ” “ it ’s otabek , right ? ” “ knew you smelled different . ” “ we should bring him here to be with you , ” yuuri added . “ no ! ” yuri snarled loud enough to silence everyone , pushing to his feet only to wince and sink back down . “ leave him alone . ” “ yuri … you know how difficult- ” seung - gil started . “ i mean it ! ” yuri bared his teeth and flattened his ears like an angry cat . guang - hong stepped closer to yuri and sank down beside him , acting on impulse as he wrapped his arms around him . it might have been close to suicide , but at least he had the advantage of being an outsider ; yuri might not immediately claw his eyes out . “ what the- ” yuri snarled , twitching back without fully dislodging his hold . “ it ’s okay . just breathe . ” guang - hong let out a soft sigh of relief when yuri at least stopped growling . it was n’t much , but it was a start . he tilted his head as viktor moved closer , dropping down to kneel in front of yuri and resting a hand on his knee . “ it ’s okay to be scared . ” yuri bared his teeth with a snarl . “ i ’m not- ” “ do you want the baby ? ” guang - hong asked softly , tensing as he felt several pairs of eyes settle on him . yuri glanced away , pressing his hand against his stomach as his ears twitched . “ i ’d make a terrible parent . ” yuuri scoffed and stepped closer . “ if that were true , i ’d never leave the kits with you unsupervised . ” guang - hong pulled back as yuuri settled on yuri ’s other side , tilting his head as he studied the blond . yuri was n’t that upset about finding out he was … pregnant ( he did n’t even want to try to fathom how that was possible right now ) , he was more upset about otabek . he glanced down at viktor . “ is being a sacrifice the only way outsiders are allowed in ? ” viktor glanced up in surprise before smiling . “ of course not ! ” he looked back at phichit . “ diplomatic visit ? ” phichit raised an eyebrow , drumming his fingers against his arm before grinning . “ diplomatic consort . ” yuri twitched as he straightened . “ haaa ? ” “ perfect ! ” viktor snapped his fingers and stood . “ what do you say ? let us bring otabek here . he wo n’t be a sacrifice . ” yuri hissed and rubbed at his stomach before slumping . “ fine . ” “ i ’ll get him , it ’ll be the quickest , ” said phichit . seung - gil turned a disapproving glare on him . “ you ’re exhausted . ” phichit scoffed . “ what kind of mage would i be if i ca n’t even do a simple teleport ? ” “ simple ? ” phichit grinned , his expression softening a bit as seung - gil continued glaring . “ one way teleport , ” he said , resting his hand on seung - gil ’s shoulder . “ promise i ’ll be careful . ” “ wait . ” yuri reached up and pulled something like a stick out of his hair , the end carved into a sleeping cat . “ so he knows i sent you … ” he muttered , handing it over . phichit took it with a look of amusement . “ thanks . ” he moved his fingers through the air and guang - hong could almost see the magic twirling and folding around him in response . he leaned closer to seung - gil and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek a moment before he vanished . “ idiot . ” seung - gil turned to leave , pausing with a glance to yuri . “ make sure you drink something . and eat whatever you think you can keep down . ” yuuri stood . “ i ’ll make some tea . can you eat some toast ? ” “ maybe . ” yuri sighed and slumped back against the table , fingers twitching where he pressed them against his stomach . guang - hong glanced at the others and somehow was n’t surprised to find leo had slipped away at some point . “ how long does it take to travel here ? ” yuri eyed him , shifting to prop an arm on the table with a soft snort . “ if he takes baron , a couple hours maybe . ” “ is baron his horse ? ” yuri ’s smirk widened . “ more like his bear . ” guang - hong stared . right . if yuri had a giant cat , of course his “ diplomatic consort ” would have a giant bear he could ride . what else would he ride ? this was n’t just some twisted dream , was it ? gods , kitsune , magic , giant cats and bears … what was next , being told he should mate with one of them ? he tensed and sat up with a flinch , glancing at yuuri . he ’d been a sacrifice , and now he was with viktor . with kits . why had n’t he realized sooner ? any sacrifice who came in either stayed or … returned home within a few weeks . the rare exceptions were the royal sacrifices , and now that he thought about it , there always seemed to be rumors of them disappearing for days or a week at a time . “ who was i brought here for ? ” viktor lifted his head from where he ’d been resting it on yuuri ’s shoulder . “ what ? ” his eyes flicked toward yuri before settling on guang - hong . he curled his fingers into fists and took a steadying breath . “ sacrifice . to be given up . who am i supposed to be sacrificed to ? ” “ that ’s not- ” “ who ? ! ” viktor pulled away from yuuri with a sigh , running his fingers through his hair . “ phichit thought you might get along well with leo , but- ” “ leo ? ” they thought he ’d get along with leo ? “ i know you two got off on the wrong foot , but he ’s really- ” guang - hong stood abruptly enough viktor stopped talking , anger and something like panic swelling up inside him . “ if i do n’t … if i do n’t … . ” he flicked his fingers . “ i ca n’t stay ? ” viktor let out a long breath through his nose . “ not usually , no . ” he sucked in a breath at the feeling of being punched in the gut . he nodded and turned to head back towards the house . how was that fair ? he needed a minute to … let the implications of it all sink in . so that was it . he was basically … here to be married off ? he shut the door behind him when he reached it and sank down onto the couch . was this how his sister felt when their father arranged her marriage with someone she hardly knew ? like everything was about to come crashing down around her ? how many times could his life change directions in just a few days ? he was overreacting , was n’t he ? would it really be so bad , being someone ’s husband ? he may not have dwelt on it too much , but he ’d always imagined he ’d be able to find someone he could comfortably spend the rest of his life with . eventually . after he somehow escaped his family ’s business . that certainly would n’t be possible with leo . not when leo despised him for no reason . why him anyway ? leo obviously did n’t want anything to do with … him … which meant leo knew why he was here ? and did n’t … want him … oh . that certainly put things in perspective . no wonder he ’d said to leave . somehow it hurt , knowing he ’d been brought here specifically for someone who could n’t even stand to look at him . what did that mean ? that no matter what he did , he ’d eventually be sent back home ? that he ’d been given a chance at a different life and might be sent back into his life of sleepless nights and blood - soaked clothing , because a … a blind - date went horribly wrong ? he dragged himself to the bedroom , glancing to the window and jumping as he saw yuuri standing there . “ sorry . did n’t mean to startle you . ” yuuri smiled , propping his chin on his crossed arms . “ you okay ? ” guang - hong sighed and dropped onto the bed . “ ‘ m fine … . ” he glanced up at yuuri , twisting the sheet in his fingers . “ is that really the only way to stay here ? ” “ i do n’t know , i ’ve only been here a few years . other than jj , any of the other sacrifices have gone to the other villages . ” yuuri pushed his glasses up . “ i think in the end , they can vote to let you stay . ” but how likely would that be ? he was already off to a bad start . “ why do they need us anyway ? ” yuuri hummed and drummed his fingers against the sill . “ they ’re a dying race . or they were , for a while . they ’re stabilising now , but … females are rare ; klara is the first female born to her generation . inari granted them a gift that allows the males to bear children , but there ’s still too few of them to be able to mate with each other . ” he shrugged with a sheepish smile . “ at least that ’s what i ’ve put together since coming here . ” “ and you were brought here for viktor ? ” “ ah … not really . i was n’t selected with anyone specific in mind as far as i know . the ritual they used to have was a festive gathering to see who took a liking to who , and i was nervous and … drank half the wine . i woke up in viktor ’s bed without remembering anything . ” he laughed and rubbed his nose . “ i punched chris trying to run away . i think they stopped having the ritual after that . sorry . ” guang - hong groaned and flopped back on the bed . yuuri sighed . “ i know you feel lost and completely out of your element , but you have time to get to know everyone . we can invite some others from the other villages if you want . i doubt they ’d force you to leave . you ’re not expected to just hook up with someone within a week . ” “ what happened to jj ? ” “ jj was … a mutual parting of ways … ” guang - hong lifted his head enough to eye yuuri . “ he did n’t exactly get along with anyone . he was the one who asked to leave . ” “ i have a feeling yuri threatened to castrate him if he did n’t , ” he muttered , smiling faintly as yuuri laughed . still , that made him feel a little better . he sighed and dropped his head back to the bed . “ okay , ” he murmured . “ i ’ll stop sulking . ” “ is this sulking or panicking ? ” he winced and groaned again . “ both ? ” he crawled off the bed with a sigh . he could n’t really be upset at finding out , he ’d wanted to know his purpose here after all . apparently he had n’t learned the lesson that curiosity killed the cat . maybe if he had n’t gone snooping through his father ’s bookkeeping all those years ago , he would n’t have been pushed so far into taking an active part in the business . “ come on , help me keep yurio from going on a rampage . he ’s nervous , but he wo n’t admit to it . ” guang - hong smiled faintly . “ over the baby or his consort ? ” yuuri laughed . “ both , but because of otabek more , i think . he ’s done his best to keep him secret . ” he raised an eyebrow at that as he headed out of the bedroom to join yuuri outside . “ why ? ” “ he does n’t like showing weakness . ” “ ah . ” there was a sentiment he could understand , though he was doing an atrociously poor job of not showing his own weaknesses . “ sorry i ’ve been a mess , ” he murmured , smiling faintly as yuuri slung an arm around his shoulders . “ … are there any other surprises i should know about though ? i ’d rather get all the shock out of my system now . ” yuuri chuckled . “ i do n’t think so . and trust me , you ’re not going to be expected to … you know , before you ’re ready . enjoy yourself , get to know everyone , and do n’t worry about trying to force something . ” guang - hong took a deep breath and nodded . “ that ’s basically what chris said . ” “ oh ? when did you talk to chris about it ? ” he flushed a bit and ducked his head . “ last night . ” he bit his tongue against the urge to mention the … silence spell . he was n’t sure why he felt he could trust and open up to yuuri , but he was sure it had something with his ‘ mother hen’ aura . “ he seems nice . ” “ everyone is pretty nice . even leo , when he ’s not being obstinate . ” yuuri squeezed his shoulders . “ are you still wanting to help out ? if you do n’t mind some manual labor , with emil on patrol we do n’t have anyone to fix any tools that break or dull . you any good at that ? ” “ maybe . ” he ’d cared for his own knives and swords , he ’d be able to at least sharpen things . “ yurio can show you around . it ’ll keep him occupied until the famous otabek arrives . ” guang - hong glanced at him with a faint smile . “ are you pawning the kits off on us , too ? ” “ i ’m not that cruel . ” he snorted quietly , straightening when yuuri pulled his arm away and moved to join viktor where he was sitting across from yuri . “ yurio , why do n’t you show guang - hong the shed ? ” yuri looked up from picking at his toast . “ why ? it ’s right over there . ” he raised an eyebrow and stared back at yuuri until he sighed . “ you ’re so stubborn . ” yuuri leaned into viktor with a roll of his eyes . guang - hong snorted softly as the three of them bickered , filling a glass with some of the flavored tea and settling next to yuri . viktor pulled out a deck of cards and they taught him how to play spielen . yuri turned out to be quite the devious tactician and he knew the other two well enough to know when to call them out . to be fair , it was n’t all that hard to break their codes once he learned they used the game as an excuse to call each other sickeningly sweet pet names . they had lunch and had gone through several more rounds , each more frenetic than the last , when they heard a commotion and what sounded like a very large animal thundering closer . he looked up in time to see a giant bear skid to a stop nearby and a tall , dark - haired human dropped from its back holding a long spear . “ yura ! ” yuri straightened , his golden ears twitching wildly as he turned towards otabek . “ beka . ” otabek dropped the spear as he fell into a crouch in front of yuri before he could stand , reaching for his hands and pressing the hair ornament into them . “ it ’s true ? ” he asked quietly . “ why did n’t you tell me ? ” “ i just found out , idiot , ” yuri snapped . guang - hong watched them from the corner of his eye as he helped gather up the cards . he did n’t miss the way yuri relaxed and clutched at otabek ’s hands , or the fact he was smiling despite the tone . it was faint , but it was there . “ you did n’t have to come . ” otabek narrowed his eyes . “ yura , if you think there is any way i am leaving knowing you ’re carrying my child- ” he started , his words cutting off as yuri pressed two fingers to his lips . he huffed against them before pulling back to look at the rest of them , his gaze landing on viktor and yuuri . “ you must be the ones he calls the idiot duo . ” “ beka ! ” “ oh , is that what he calls us ? ” viktor propped his chin up on his fist . “ yuuri , did you know he had such a vulgar name for us ? ” yuuri handed the rest of the cards to guang - hong . “ i figured he called us something . honestly , i thought it ’d be worse . ” yuri groaned and slumped forward to press his face into otabek ’s shoulder . “ i hate you . ” “ that ’s going to make raising a child together difficult . ” guang - hong could n’t help grinning as he saw yuri ’s ears going red . viktor chuckled . “ maybe you should take otabek home . you two have a lot to discuss . ” yuri grumbled before yelping as otabek scooped him up . “ dammit , beka , put me down ! ” “ where ’s your home ? i want to see it . ” otabek nodded to them before turning and carrying a loudly protesting yuri towards his home . “ do n’t miss dinner ! ” yuuri called after them , snorting when yuri gave them the middle finger in response . “ that went well . ” viktor grinned . “ our family is growing . ” he kissed yuuri ’s temple and stood , looking to guang - hong . “ come on , i ’ll show you to the tools if you still want to try your hand at them . ” halfway there , he heard a loud growl and turned just in time to see sasha leap through the air and pounce on otabek ’s bear . he shook her off and they circled each other with bared teeth until they butted heads and … rubbed against each other . well then . apparently they got along as well as their owners . he glanced to viktor when he chuckled and they continued to the shed . it was simple enough , and all the tools and supplies were kept neat and organized . “ thank you . for helping yurio earlier . ” guang - hong glanced up at viktor with a smile . “ it was fun . i have n’t played cards in ages . ” viktor shook his head . “ no , i mean when you helped calm him down … he has a tendency to overreact to things . ” he shrugged , glancing away and fiddling with a small tub of spare parts . “ he was panicking . ” he ’d done that enough himself to know it helped if someone was there to make you breathe . he looked up in surprise as viktor rested a hand on his shoulder . “ i ’m sorry i made you upset . you ’re welcome to stay here as long as you like . ” guang - hong smiled in relief . “ thank you . ” viktor patted his shoulder . “ holler if you need anything . ” he watched viktor go and let out a sigh as he looked back to the tools . there was a pedal - powered grinding stone in the corner and he wrinkled his nose , poking through the supplies until he found some whetstones . there were a couple daggers dull enough they would n’t even cut his skin and he settled in to work on sharpening them . caring for his weapons had always been a task he could put his whole into , despite knowing what he ’d have to use them for . his weapons were just objects until given a purpose , and objects were useless if they were n’t cared for . he soon lost himself in the rhythmic scrape of stone on metal . it was soothing . relaxing . tension eased out of him and he found himself humming tunelessly as he finished the first one . he grabbed a thick strip of leather to swipe the blade on , testing its edge and setting it aside when he found it sharp . he picked up another and was just finishing with it when he noticed someone watching him , looking up to find leo at the entrance . “ hey , ” he said with a smile . it dissipated when leo ignored him , stepping inside and setting an axe and a large knife on the table . so he was back to being a jerk . he sighed and turned his attention back to the dagger . “ you ’re not needed here . ” he tensed , aware leo meant he did n’t need him here , but that did n’t matter , did it ? “ someone thought so . ” he sighed and lifted his head as he felt the warnings of a headache ; he really did n’t want to deal with an argument when he ’d just found something to distract him . “ do n’t you have more important things to do ? ” leo ’s ears twitched and he bared his teeth a moment before leaving with a huff . guang - hong sighed and slumped on the stool once he was alone again , finishing the dagger and picking up the knife . he was n’t sure what he should do about leo . should he avoid him , or try to befriend him ? part of him wanted to know why leo seemed to hate him so much , but it was n’t worth the headache . once he finished sharpening everything , he cleaned up and explored the rest of the shed . other than the grinding stone , the only other large equipment was a small forge built into a back corner . shelves lined the walls , most will jars or spare parts , though one was filled with trinkets with a box of metal and wood pieces beneath . on closer inspection , the trinkets were tiny figurines of various shapes and sizes - over two dozen plants and animals and a larger one that covered his hand and looked like a dragonfly . the delicate metal wings were practically transparent , enough he could see his hand through them , and the eyes were tiny black , faceted gems . he grinned as he moved a wing and they both moved simultaneously . whoever made it was gifted . he set it back on the shelf and headed back to see if yuuri needed help with dinner . the sun was lower than it should have been , which meant he ’d lost more time than he thought . viktor was lounging at the table while yuuri set bowls and plate of food out , tugging him closer every time he brought a new one over to steal a kiss . their kits were nearby , playing chase with the bear and tiger . he paused halfway , not wanting to intrude , but viktor spotted him and waved him over . “ we were about to summon everyone for dinner . ” “ you were about to eat half the potatoes before yurio could get to them , ” yuri said with a snort . viktor gasped . “ i would never deprive an innocent soul of potatoes . ” guang - hong raised an eyebrow as he dropped down at the table . after seeing the two of them fighting over the last piece of bacon , he did n’t believe that . “ you ’re talking about the baby are n’t you ? ” viktor winked . “ maybe . ” “ not maybe . ” yuri set a plate of biscuits on the table before poking the top of viktor ’s head . “ go rouse the troops , you fiend . ” viktor stood and swatted yuri with his tail on his way out . guang - hong snagged a biscuit . “ this looks delicious . you made all of this ? ” “ viktor helped a bit . ” yuuri filled two glasses with tea and set one in front of him as he sat across from him . the others trickled in a few minutes later . yuri and otabek followed after viktor , fingers laced together , and even from the table , he could see the scowl and flush on yuri ’s face . they sat next to each other at the end of the table , yuri next to guang - hong with otabek on the end . viktor setted the kits next to yuuri before sitting on their other side , and chris took a seat on guang - hong ’s other side . leo sat on chris’ other side and he was grateful for the barrier between him and the surly fox . emil arrived with seung - gil and he tilted his head , glancing at yuuri with a slight frown . was n’t he on patrol , or was he getting their names mixed up ? yuuri caught his eye with a faint smile . “ emil brought phichit back . he passed out on the way . i do n’t think he ’ll be waking up before tomorrow . ” he shook his head with a sigh . “ he really should n’t have teleported . ” “ he was that exhausted ? ” emil sat on yuuri ’s other side and seung - gil next to him , his expression rivaling leo ’s for most constipated . “ magical exhaustion is different , and worse , than just being tired . he could have gotten himself killed , ” seung - gil all but growled . “ but he did n’t . no sense worrying about it now , ” chris said , snagging a biscuit before he started scooping food onto his plate . seung - gil clenched his fist on top of the table , grinding his teeth . “ so . otabek . how long are you staying with us ? ” viktor asked , smiling blithely as the tension at the table eased considerably . “ until the child is old enough to start a family of its own . ” yuri spit tea across the table , narrowly missing viktor ’s face . “ are you insane ? ” otabek tilted his head . “ no . ” yuri ’s mouth moved , but no sounds came out , until he finally groaned and buried his face in his arms . guang - hong bit his lip to keep from laughing , digging into his food as yuuri and viktor drilled otabek with questions about his home and why he ’d never visited earlier . apparently , otabek had asked once , only for yuri to deny him , and he had n’t dared to ask again . his kingdom was responsible for much of the ore and fur trade to the other kingdoms , and his family regulated both to prevent eradication of either . he blinked as chris leaned into him as they were finishing their meal . “ what are your plans for the evening ? ” “ i … had n’t thought about it , ” guang - hong replied , a shiver going up his spine . chris was n’t … was he ? “ interested in a swim ? ” “ uh … i do n’t have a swimsuit , ” he replied , sounding lame even to his own ears . chris smirked and shrugged . “ go naked . i usually do . ” guang - hong turned red , clamping a hand over his mouth to stifle the squeak . “ kidding , kidding ! ” chris chuckled and reached for his drink . “ i ’m sure someone has one you can borrow . ” “ o - okay . i might just … sit on the bank and watch ? ” “ do n’t like swimming ? ” guang - hong flushed and picked up his own drink . “ um … not sure . ” he cringed as he felt chris eyeing him and sighed . “ i ’ve never been . ” “ really ? huh . ” chris shrugged . “ want to learn ? ” he bit his lip as he considered . he was tempted to go back to the house and read , but he really should try to spend time with them , right ? and chris was n’t so bad . he might have actually been … not cute , but … sexy ? “ sure . ” what exactly was he getting himself into ?</td>\n",

       "      <td>united - under - skyfall : united - under - skyfall : united - under - skyfall : ignoremeatthispoint : united - under - skyfall : okay , guys , listen up . i ’ve seen a lot of hate going around for different writers ( just three examples are @hamimagines @forlifeloveandhappiness and @offiicialhamilton - and that ’s just on tumblr , and just in the world of hamilton fanfics , and just the ones i can think of off of the top of my head ) and they ’ve all been really gracious about it and dealing with it well and everything , but i ’m addressing this right here and right now . if you do n’t like their stories , do n’t f cking read them . if you do n’t like the way they ended , keep it to yourself or rant to your friends . imagine it ended some other way . do n’t give them sh t about it . if you do n’t like their lack of updates , then get over it . it ’s not your choice to dictate when they ’ll update and when they wo n’t . if you do n’t want to wait , then stop reading their stuff , imagine your own scenarios as to how it could end up going or what ’s coming next , or find something else to read for the time being . everyone on here is a normal person , just like you or me . everyone on here has a life outside of social media . sports , homework , college , extracurriculars , jobs , family , friends , pets , traveling , etc . , etc . they ’re not robots ready to write another fic every time you ’re occupied with another one just so you ’ll never run out of material to read . they have other things to be doing , and we all need to respect that . ( also , ever heard of this thing called writer ’s block ? gasp ! it exists ! and it f*cking sucks - trust me , i ’ve had it before ! ) i have n’t updated any of my wattpad fics in probably a year , and some people say they ’ll update and then do n’t for the next three to seven years ( or ever again ! ) be glad they ’re writing at all ! i know this is n’t my battle to fight for the three mentioned above , but this is an issue that not only do i feel rather close to as a writer on another site , but i ’ve seen it happen all over the place to all sorts of people , and i ’m not about to sit here while you make others feel down about themselves because you ’ve run out of reading material and need someone to take it out on ! i ’ve seen this far too much on far too many sites and something needs to be done about it , so this is me , telling you exactly what i think about all the negative things you have to say to these writers . do you know how hard it is to publish your writing for anyone in the world to see at any given time ? it ’s terrifying ! you have no idea how people will react and get extremely self conscious about your writing - nitpicking every little thing and taking out some of your favorite parts just because you think others wo n’t like it . let me tell you right now that it took me a long time to get over it , and it kept coming back to me . heck , probably the last five chapters on most of my actually published stories are all boring and pointless author ’s notes from a year ago ! i get horrible writers block and i ’ve never finished a story ! i ’ve written so many drabbles that i ’m too afraid to share with anyone and i have two wattpad accounts just so if i write something i think my friends wo n’t like , they wo n’t see it because it ’ll be on my “ closet account . ” so yeah , pretty freaking terrifying , and it ’s a major blow to my confidence every time someone even reads over my work without smiling - even worse when people criticize it . do you know how bad it makes me feel when someone calls me an * * * hole because i wo n’t update , continually badgers me about the way i write something , or says i suck at writing ? i can guarantee you right now that it makes most writers feel awful , but even though a lot of them can get over it ( sorry , i ’m not exactly one who does it easily ) , there are still some who ca n’t , or are going through something so tough that some little comment that would n’t bother you could have concussive effects on their life , and you ’d have no idea who they were before you did it or what happened once you did . i get it , you have a life , too , and you ’d like to be able to sit back and enjoy a few hours of reading - believe me , i do that all the time - but there are other sites you can find fics on , actual books you can read , ones you ’ve already read that you can reread , ones you might want to write yourself , and of course , other wonderful authors out there ! to all the writers out there who are brave enough to post their writing online ( or anywhere - or maybe not at all ) , you ’re amazing , and i really appreciate your hard work , even if i have n’t read your writing , and even if it is n’t exactly my cup of tea . do n’t let anybody get you down or tell you otherwise because even if your writing is still in it ’s developing stages , just a few weeks can do wonders for your thought process on your stories or your writing style . if you feel like you need more fics ( or non - fic stories ) to read because apparently you ca n’t handle waiting for an update from anyone on here , or you feel like you ’d like to spread your writing or need a different scene for it , then i ’d suggest , if you have n’t already tried them , either ao3 ( archivesofourown.com ) , wattpad ( wattpad.com ) , or ffn ( fanfiction.net ) okay , rant over , thanks for listening :) i ’d just like to bring this post back for @magicalcloud16 because it seems that , once again , people just are n’t getting it . do n’t listen to them ! i ’ve never read any of your works , but i ’m sure they ’re awesome ! it takes a lot of guts to post your writing on here and you should n’t let people bring you down because of it . if they do n’t like the way you do things , they can take a hike . in light of recent events concerning several different accounts on here ( i ’m so sorry @hamiltonsquills is the only one i can think of at the moment ) i ’d just like to reiterate the fact that the writer ’s on this site are not , in any way , shape or form , obligated to cater to your every will . they are not writing machines with no emotions and no other interests , they are human , and while everyone pretends to get that , i ’m seriously starting to doubt the fact that some of you do . “ how dare you treat your followers like that ” ? unfollow them if it bothers you so much . “ we ’ve been waiting so long and all we get is this crappy chapter ? ” boo hoo . cry me a river . now build a bridge and get over it . not everything they write is going to be your cup of tea , and considering how much time these people take out of their lives to write those “ crappy chapters , ” i think you can stand to wait a little longer . and another thing : if you have a problem with their work , gently tell them in a way that ’s considered constructive criticism and will actually help them in the future rather than damage their self esteem because you ’re having a bad day or their writing is n’t up to whatever standards you have . there ’s literally thousands of other things you could be reading and doing instead of complaining . “ look … we get it … . you hate yourself and you think that everyone else hates you too . but do n’t you think you should sort off keep that “ behind the curtains ” ? you ’re being such a downer and it ’s not cool . maybe if you tried being more positive more people would like you ? ? ? just keeping it real . “ excuse me ? do n’t you dare presume to know any of these people or what they ’re going through in their lives right now . it ’s their blog and they can do whatever the fuck they want with it - which means it ’s not just writing that ’s going to go up there , most of the time . this means they can rant if they want to . if it bothers you , stop looking at their posts and move on to another blog . just people liking them does n’t magically solve all of their life ’s problems , and just because someone likes them , it does n’t mean that they ca n’t argue , be mentally , physically or verbally abusive , or get into fights of one sort or another . also , in many cases , someone ’s blog would be considered “ behind the curtains , ” thank you very fucking much . “ just keeping it real ? ” you ’re telling them not to be themselves or show vulnerability and posting from a completely anonymous source at the same time , and you ’re “ just keeping it real ” ? that ’s absolutely , one hundred percent laughable and quite possibly one of the most hypocritical things i ’ve heard in my life . though it may come as news to some of you , these people have lives . yes , actual lives , where they have other things to do than writing and trying to keep you , total and complete strangers , happy with them . furthermore , yes , they are , in fact , people . they are not machines . they have school and sports and jobs and pets and family and friends and their own mental and physical health and basic every day needs like sleeping , eating and drinking that they all need to prioritize , often over their hobby writing . ( yes , even if they ’re actually an author or a journalist . most of the writing i ’ve seen on here is hobby writing , and that ’s exactly what i ’m addressing here ) sometimes , people need to vent , but have no one or nothing to vent to , and if they turn to tumblr or any other site to do it , then that ’s their choice , regardless of what you , me , or anybody else may think of it . if you start reading their post and realize it ’s simply them venting , and you ’re getting so annoyed with them doing it that much , then keep on scrolling . just as they are not obligated to write fics for you , you are not obligated to read every damn thing they post , which should eliminate any problems you have with their venting or any need for complaint . they do not owe you anything . they are their own people , and you , whoever you are and regardless of what you might think , have no right to try to dictate how they should act , what they should wear , who they should be , what they should write , what they should post or what they should do . also , i do recall running across someone saying , “ oh , do n’t tell me you ’re a feminist . i actually liked you . ” if you have a problem with their fucking view on the world , then sigh quietly to yourself and ignore it . if you ’re going to ignore everything i just said , at least do us all a favor and , if you ’re so sure that you ’re all high and mighty and know just the right solution for their problems because of course you know exactly what their lives are like , or that they owe you anything or are too slow or their writing quality sucks , then come out of the anonymous section , because from here , it looks an awful lot like cowards speaking a fool ’s language to the brave souls confident enough in their own skin to share their writing or artwork . and yes , it does take a lot of confidence or a very large push to do such a thing , because there ’s always the fear that it ’s never good enough and people will reject just like you ’ve been doing , so do n’t ii fucking dare try to tear down that confidence or make whatever they ’re going through any fucking worse . while we ’re at it , i ’d like to remind all of you that something very similar happened to a friend of ours on wattpad , and the effects were worse than any of you probably think it will be . none of us saw that coming . you have no idea if someone else will be next because of your off - the - cuff spiteful comment . think before you send . and if you wanna fucking fight someone about any of this , fight me , not them , because if you ca n’t already tell i ’m fucking ready to fight , and though i ’d much rather not , i ’d prefer you not take out your shitty day or something else and your opinions on one of them , most of whom who do absolutely nothing to deserve the hate you give them . i ’m not saying it ’s my job to jump in to any of these people ’s fights , because i ’m fully aware that they ’ve got this situation handled because they ’re all awesome , but i ’m telling you this anyways because this should be common knowledge , and , apparently , it ’s not . when people do this , it makes my blood boil , as previously mentioned in my original post , because i ’ve seen this on so many sites and it ’s just not acceptable . do n’t talk to any of them that way until you fully understand what they ’re going through in their lives and know what it ’s like to be a writer yourself . ripcanyoulikenot ( our previously mentioned wattpad friend ) somebody hold onto my crocs right fucking now i have been summoned * ties back hair * all right let ’s get down to shit . our next field trip will be to @imagineham ​ ‘s blog ( aka queen steph ) buckle up , kiddos , ‘ cause i ’m starting to get really fucking angry with all these pissy anons all over the place taking out their sour day on amazing people who do n’t fucking deserve it . “ we came here for writing , not to take a break ” excuse me ? there ’s over two hundred brilliant writers for this fucking fandom . if you in your oh - so - ignorant glory can find it in yourself the time to tell steph that she does n’t have your permission to take a break , then you can also find the time to either a ) find something else to read . did you know that there are nearly one hundred thirty million books in modern history that ’ve been published globally ? yes , my friends , one hundred thirty m i l l i o n . wow , that ’s a lot of reading . you must really have run out of reading material if you ’re so pressed for literature that you ’re banning steph from taking a break . does that mean you ’ve read all of them ? no ? oh , i did n’t think so . lookie here - there ’s this thing called a library and unless you have an incredible reading speed , are almost a hundred years old or have a photographic memory , i sincerely doubt you have read all of the surprisingly limited texts you can find in one , even for one genre . if you do n’t have a library near you , i ’m sure you know some friends or relatives who can lend you a book or two , or possibly writing of their own . even if they ’re not all your cup of tea , if someone asks you for a suggestion for one later , it might seem like the one for them , and you ’ll be glad you knew about it , wo n’t you ? you also might develop a taste for that subject or style of writing later on in life and decide to give it another try , or need something like it as a reference for something you ’re writing , a good quote , or even a speech or debate you ’re preparing for . if you for some reason ca n’t get ahold of someone who might be able to give you a book you have n’t read yet , you might have one of your own lying around . if you do n’t , then it ’s always fun to reread some of the classics or your old favorites , right ? but remember , that ’s just in actual published books - not even touching upon the realm of fanfiction or books that have n’t been actually published outside of a writing site , of which there ’s probably just as many ! once again , i offer ao3 , wattpad and ffn as alternative options . not to mention , there ’s probably well over two hundred writers in the hamilton fandom you can find just on tumblr , so you should n’t have to rely on steph . thank goodness for that - otherwise we could ’ve run into some problems , am i right ? * raises eyebrow pointedly * my point is - there ’s literally millions of options for you out there . try expanding your range a little bit . what i said earlier about rereading ? it ’s not like that ’s taboo or anything . you can do it in the fanfic world , too . as far as i can tell , steph may be taking a break , but she ’s not planning on deleting all of her writing . calm down . they ’re not going anywhere . if you need some help finding writers in the hamilton fandom , i will personally post all of the hamilton writers i follow ( it ’s a lot , but it ’s certainly not all of them ) so you can find some sort of a basis to go with . i ’m sure there ’s at least one or two awesome users who you have n’t seen yet . b ) realize that sometimes a writer needs to take a break . steph is literally amazing and she ’s helped so many writers , artists and users who she does n’t even know by sending them encouraging messages , always being upbeat , and producing tons of fics on her own free time . she did n’t need to do any of that . she could go around telling everyone how atrocious their sense of humor is , or how awful their writing is and how stupid their artwork is and constantly post about how she hates the world and everyone in it and rip on others like you ’re doing to her and post a thirty word fic that ’s literally just a jumble of words every five and a half months . but she does n’t . which do you prefer ? when you do this to writers and discourage them from taking breaks and put pressure on them to finish stories and then immediately start writing another one , somehow assuming it to be possible that they can do so without needing a break , you ’re only making it worse for yourself as a reader . it puts stress on the writer that they do n’t need , especially when for most people who write on these sites , writing is supposed to be a stress reliever . instead of taking the time they need to write fics that they feel good about themselves and that you actually enjoy from them in the first place , which can take anywhere from a day to several months for a single short story , they ’ll rush , because you ’re expecting them to please you with more more more , which makes their fics sloppier than normal , something they ’re not happy with , and something you are n’t happy with , either . maybe i should ’ve addressed this first - a writer holds absolutely no obligation to their readers . sure , maybe a professional writer does , because it ’s literally their job to make readers happy and keep buying their works , but the writers on these sites do it for the pure enjoyment , and trying to turn their creative process into something you can control on a timer takes that away from them . you ’re only going to make them hate something they love , and that is a truly disgraceful thing to do . when you put this pressure on them to write quicker , i can almost guarantee you that it ’ll never turn out as well as they would ’ve liked it , which will always linger in the back of their minds . in addition to this , because it probably wo n’t be up to their usual standards , it ’s probably not whatever quality of writing you ’re used to seeing from them , and that ’s only going to make you disappointed or angry with them , which many of you will tell them , which will only make them disappointed or angry with theirselves , which will stress them out even more and is n’t good for their mental , and by extension , physical health . do you see where i ’m going here ? it ’s a vicious cycle . you may not see it in steph yet , nor may you ever , but if you do this to writers , ninety nine percent of the time , you ’re eventually going to see a downwards spiral in their writing . that ’s because by being rude , hurtful and pressuring , you ’re making them feel worse about themselves and their work , and that ’s going to , at some level , be reflected in their writing . writers have a life to worry about , too . pets that need taking care of . family members and friends that want to see them , need help getting around or need someone to look after them . jobs that they have to get to to pay the bills , keep on their feet and survive , and school and classes that have to take priority to get those jobs , or that they would n’t need jobs if they did n’t have them . they have to eat , drink , sleep and relieve themselves , all to stay healthy and stay alive . a lot of people who might ’ve taken the time to read this are probably rolling their eyes at the face that i added that part , because it should ’ve been obvious , but i feel that it needed to be said . many writers i know on this site suffer from social anxiety , anxiety in general , depression , or are suffering through a loved one they ’ve lost somehow . many of them have to do different physical and mental exercises that they have to remember to do as well as medicine that they have to remember to take to keep them focused , keep them from doing something drastic , and again , just to keep themselves healthy in general , for a number of different reasons i do n’t pretend to know . if they write as often as you want them to , then a number of things could happen . 1 . ) they might skip meals , which goes without saying is very unhealthy , especially if such a thing becomes a habit . 2 . ) they ’ll probably cut back on sleep , which is n’t healthy , either , and makes it harder to focus and function in school and at work . 3 . ) they ’ll become distant from their friends and family . this is n’t good for their social life . humans crave human company . if you push away those closest to you , it ’s really hard to find those connections again , especially if you have anxiety and/or social anxiety like some might , or something similar , which can make talking to new people , making friends and rebuilding relationships hard . 4 . ) they could forget to take mandatory meds , which considering the vast , diverse population of the world , could lead to any number of unforeseeable problems . all of this is n’t good for their mental or physical health . they can get unexplained pains . they can become dehydrated and/or malnourished . they ’ll not get enough sleep , which can be just as bad as not getting enough food or water . the skipped medicine i wo n’t even go into , as there ’s hundreds of things that could happen . overall , they wo n’t be in good shape . they ’ll be stressed , snappish , tired , emotional , and some might even do something as drastic as self harm or committing suicide . scary thought , right ? even scarier of a thought to think that you might actually be a factor to it , i ’m sure . you do n’t think it will happen until it actually does . if you ’re so on their case about them writing , then i ’m sure you ’d rather have a writer on the other side of the screen then an empty chair , someone coming to deliver the bad news to you , or someone coming to delete their blog , would n’t you ? breaks can do wonders for the human mind , one ’s overall mood , and the creative process , whether that break is only five minutes or as long as five years . you ca n’t tell people what to do and what not to do , especially if it ’s over the internet , where you do n’t even really know them . steph , as well as everyone else here , can do whatever the hell they want , especially if it ’s in the best interest of their physical and mental health , and you ’re not one to tell them otherwise , no matter who they are . i realize this may sound hypocritical , because i ’m telling you not to hate on writers or be pressuring to them . i ’m not telling you that you ca n’t . i ’m sure multiple people will turn around and send me rude messages in response to this , saying i have no clue what i ’m talking about , and that ’s fine by me , so long as you do n’t do it to anyone else . i ’m simply trying to drill into your minds what your little moments of irritation and a quick impulse message can do . this means that no one owes you anything , no matter how much you might think it . c ) to realize : yes , we realize you went there for the fics . but fics are more like admission fees and awesome writers , both in their writing and outside of it , are more like food . ( i ’m not saying you should eat them . i like my writing friends to be perfectly alive and uneaten , thank you very much . ) and , of course , like my friends are fond of saying when we try to advertise our school ’s dances ( joy oh joy , perks of being on student council ) : come for the admission fee , stay for the food ! if it does n’t make sense then i ’m afraid you just are n’t going to get it . “ but you ca n’t go ! we need your fics ! ” i ’m sorry , but i googled it , and apparently there ’s no way to change fics into world peace , water , oxygen , money for the poor , happiness or shelter . check again next week . in conclusion : breaks : are good , and we should all take one once in awhile . writers : can do whatever the hell they want . rude anons : can fuck off . “ just because you like my stuff does n’t mean i owe you anything . ” ~bob dylan p.s . i did tell you i ’d be ready to fight someone . you just made the mistake of taking the fight to steph first . i literally spent an hour and a half writing just this most recent add - on to this post . do not underestimate me because i really have so much to say on this topic . and , because i promised , but just for hamilton writers ( and a few others in the fandom to help keep you busy ) because honestly i do n’t follow enough people from other fandoms to really be of any help there ( but if there ’s anybody who runs across this and has a good base to cover for any other fandoms , or indeed , more from the hamilton fandom as well , please add it to this , because i know writer hate happens everywhere and i ’d like it to stop in as many places as possible ) : i ’m sorry if this annoys some of the writers being tagged , but please understand i ’m really trying to help with the writer hate and i ’m hoping if i give people a good selection they wo n’t feel the need to hate on other writers because they are n’t posting fics or they are n’t   “ good enough ” for them and that they can just keep it to themselves and find a fic from a different writer . @a - schuylerr @adothoe @alexanderhamllton @and - peggy - yall @building - palaces - from - paragraphs @completehamiltontrash @coolbeanbinch @damn - man - ham - fam @daveeddiggsit @daveedsponytail @dearhamiltons @diggs4life @dont - be - petty - be - peggy @elizabethschxyler @exhibits - no - restraint @fanfrickinhamiltasticimagines @forlifeloveandhappiness @gratitudejoyandsorrow @ham - iltonima - gines @hamil - garbage @hamil - tons @hamilton - noodles @hamilton4laurens @hamiltonimaginess @hamiltonimaginessss @hamiltonmagines @hamiltonwrotetheother51 @hamiltonxoneshot @hamimagines @hamitome – imagines @hamlltvn @hamwriters @helplessly - burning @helplesslylins @hercules - mullifan @iamnotthrowingawaymyshit @imagineham @imagines - hamilton @imagining - haamilton @imwillingtowriteforit @insane - hamilton - imagines @iputmyselfintothenarrative @ithoughtyouweredifferent @its - the - hamfam @iwrotemywayto - revolution @keepingupwithlinmanuel @l - nmanuel @linmanuel - istheman - da @literallylin @lookaroundlookaroundhowlucky @love - doesnt - discriminate @manuelmirandamn @manuelmiranduh @marquis - de - labaguette @matt10nt @moarhamiltonxreader @momentsthatthewordsdontreach @more - ham - imagines @musicalmiranda @myalexanderhamiltonjustyouwait @nobeatnomelody @nonstop - laurens @not - angelica - schuyler @notthrowingawaymymemes @on - written - wings @onlytolive @oogeeky - girlyoo @ourforgottenboleros @pastpatientlywaitingforimagines @please - say - hamilton @protecting - my - legacy @psychedemigod @running - out - of - time - imagines @ruth - hamilton - delrio @saynotofics @secretschuylersister @sevenisalivingmeme @strongenoughfoundation @sunshinemiranda @tenduelimagines @thatoneimaginesblog @theimaginesofhamilton @theroomwhereitswritten @timeforhamilton @ton - of - ham @womenarethesequel @writingiseasier @yayhamletnonstop @yourobedientslytherin there you go , eighty eight hamilton writers or hamilton fandom related blogs i have separated from the list of blogs i follow . all of them are amazing , and i have helpfully alphabetized them for you . remember there are hundreds of others . you have literally no excuse for giving them hate because   “ they are n’t updating fast enough ” or   “ their writing was n’t good enough ” or anything of that caliber , when there ’s so many other things you could be reading , as well as so many other things you could be doing instead of reading if you really and truly have run out of things to read . better yet , go visit @a - hurricane - came and leave any hate or complaints you have there , because that ’s my blog , and i ’d be happy to take any hate or complaints you have there if it means other writers are n’t going to be getting it . this is really important and everyone should take a minute of their time to read it ! writing is a pastime for most of us , not a job . it does n’t matter if you post a new fic per day or per week or only had posted one , you ’re awesome for doing it and do n’t deserve to be told otherwise ! so if you need it , listen to eliza and take a break . no one has the right to send hateful comments to you for the mere fact of being human and having necessities ( ’cause no , you ca n’t survive just by writing ) . just ignore them and keep being the wonderful person you are!~    ♡ ♡ thanks so much for tagging me in this , let ’s spread the love for all the beautiful writers !</td>\n",

in an attempt to even the playing - field , cas has been doing his yoga every morning in his boxers - briefs in the living room ( long before sam wakes up , but just in time for dean to stumble out of the bedroom to get his first cup of coffee while cas is in a full - straddle forward fold , the wheel pose , or , his personal favorite , the reclining bound angel ) . so far he ’s been tackled twice by dean who ’s flimsy excuse of “ i tripped on the rug ” did n’t play either time . however , despite his nearly - naked yoga and pictures sent of himself riding his favorite dildo , castiel is severely outmatched . dean is just too sexy , and he knows all of the buttons to push . he knows that he can almost level cas with a hungry stare from across the room . he knows that cas likes it rough and has no second thoughts about pushing cas into a wall or against the door and kissing him or spanking him hard as they walk by each other . hell , cas has been fondled and groped in every quiet corner of the house , even while sam ’s been home and the only thing keeping him quiet are two of dean ’s thick fingers shoved in his mouth . yesterday , dean had snuck up behind him and wrapped a hand around his throat , squeezing just enough to make cas’ heart rate spike up . “ do n’t touch yourself tonight . or tomorrow . can you do that for me ? ” dean had whispered quietly as sam was only a few feet away . cas whimpered and nodded , very sure of what he was agreeing to . dean squeezed his throat a little harder , drawing a whine out of cas , and then said , “ good boy , ” before licking the shell of his ear . cas nearly came in his pants . and tonight sam was staying with his girlfriend . evidently dean was n’t going to waste a second of their alone time . “ i wonder how many times i can make you come before he gets home tomorrow . ” dean breaks the kiss and growls out the words in a low rumble against cas’ lips . it makes him shudder and his head knocks against the wall behind him with a thud . “ think i can get you to black out again ? ” cas groans with that memory but he does n’t want to come across as easy so he teases dean with “ i do n’t know , you might be losing your touch … ” then dean easily strips off cas’ shirt and tosses it to the side . “ dean … ” cas whines , now definitely sounding easy and desperate for whatever dean will give him . “ man , you made some beautiful sounds that night . you sang for me baby , you remember that ? ” dean seems lost in the memory , too . “ man , i wish i’da recorded that … ” continue reading on ao3</td>\n",

( my best work ) nsfw smuttery - here &amp; here . if you want to see more examples , let me know . some feedback from people who have privately commissioned me in the past : “ mello always delivers when it comes to writing .   he ’s written a few stories for me before .   i always received them promptly and they were very high quality .   10/10 would recommend . ” - @kingcandy ​ “ mello wrote me a long , steamy fanfic in less than 24 hours ! how ? ! ” - @bumblepuppy ​ “ i ’ve known mello for years and his writing has only gotten better over time ! not only has he written five stories for me ( six if you count the story my gf bought for me : ’ ) ) , he ’s helped me edit in the past . mello has a really speedy turnaround , even for the fic for a movie he had n’t seen . he takes care when it comes to writing stuff for other people , making sure to add in little details ( though , it might ’ve been easy with me since i ’m an open fucking book and he knows me ) that make a great fic all the better . the times that he ’s written for me , he has n’t judged me at all for my weird specific kinks ( at least , in a serious non - friendly way he has nt , lmfao . he ’s a professional and all as well so ! ! ) so you do n’t have to worry about that sort of thing . i highly recommend him if you want some good fuckin shit ™ . ” - @rockmacbeth ​ in terms of pricing … .. 1500 - 3000 words : £ 10 3000 - 4500 words : £ 17 4500 - 6000 words : £ 24 6000 - 7500 words : £ 30 7500 + words : £ 30 base , and an extra £ 6 per 1500 words . for smut / nsfw : 1500 - 3000 words : £ 13 3000 - 4500 words : £ 20 4500 - 6000 words : £ 28 6000 - 7500 words : £ 34 7500 + words : message me first , we ’ll talk . in theory , i ’m happy to write you something of any length . i can and will write you a novel if you have the money for it . if you ask for something in the 3k-4.5k area , say , and it ends up being 4.7k i will not charge you for the extra . sometimes i end up writing more than i expected , but whatever price we agree on is what you pay . i can only really take money through paypal at this time , so paypal it ’ll be . as for what i will write , i will work with any fandom and any original characters . if i do not know the canon , i ’ll do my research , but if you can tell me about your personal experience of the characters , it ’ll help ! i will write fanfiction , original fiction , or canon / oc fiction and pairings . i will write basically any ship , setting , or au . i ’ll do you your original characters in your own universe if you want to see someone else handle them . i ’ll write you the 20k slow burn of your oc and your video game lovely . whatever you like ! just drop me a message . that said , there are a couple of small things i ca n’t / wo n’t do . no non - con , or essentially non - con ( including anything where one person could not reasonably give consent ) . furry stuff i ca n’t really do , i ’m afraid , not my area . nothing that ’s like outright racist or sexist or transphobic or what have you . i also wo n’t write you anything nsfw if you ’re under eighteen . on the other hand , i am fine with gore . i ’m a horror writer , so anything disturbing ( in that sense ) is fine by me . as for specific kinks , you ’d have to ask , but i consider myself open - minded . for other people i ’ve written crossdressing , eye - licking , cherry popping , and puke , among others , so take that how you will . please send me a message if you are interested ! in an initial message , i mostly want to know the type of thing you want written and the length / price you had in mind . we can discuss it in more detail after that . my asks and messaging are both open . if you ’re curious about whether i ’ll write something , but are shy to ask , you can send me an anon . other than that , please reblog this post to help me get some spread ! thank you very much !</td>\n",

your name , for example the one where you get the name of the person in their handwriting on your body somewhere at a certain age the one where the first thing they say to you appears instead the one where you get each others’ fingerprints the one where you get matching marks / symbols / tattoos the one where your marks or words that change depending on what ’s going on with your soulmate(s ) the one with the clock that counts down the time until you meet your soulmate(s ) ( multiple clock for multiple soulmates ? one click until you meet them both ? unexpected third soulmate showing up after the clocks drop ? ) the one where when you sleep you dream of whatever they ’re experiencing from their point of view until you find them , or after you find them the one where you can straight up talk to them in dreams until / after you find them the one where you form a telepathic / empathetic link until / after you find them the one where you share extreme physical sensation until / after you find them ; if one of you hurts the other one hurts , if one of you is getting lucky the other one gets a little hot and bothered the one where the closer you are to them the more aware of them you become , and you find them playing a hot / cold game ;

characters who have been through trauma who do n’t want to touch people hard of hearing characters like clint barton who ca n’t hear their soulmate speak without hearing aids / at all or on the flipside   characters who ca n’t speak ; maybe it still works in sign language , or maybe it does n’t people who ca n’t read / can’t read the language the words on their body are in characters like bucky barnes who ’ve lost hands and/or had their fingerprints removed soulmate clocks that time out in the middle of the crowd ; there ’s an entire craigslist category for finding who else was there that day with a clock that timed out too famous characters speaking to or performing for a crowd and suddenly their world is in color / their clock times out / etc and every member of the audience pretends to be this celebrity ’s soulmate and a cinderella type situation ensues with the finding soulmates playing the hot / cold game and they keep missing each other insomniacs who rarely sleep , much less at the same time / different time than their soulmates soulmate ot3s / ot4s / otmores where you dream in varying people ’s povs every time you sleep and get super confused people who get sick or injured and frantically search for their soulmates   so they can survive people who need to be in medically induced comas and their soulmates have to stay away so they do n’t accidentally wake them up the one where soulbonding is actually a choice and someone chooses to bond with someone they may not know or like to save their lives and have to figure out if they can unbond or if they have to live with the situation ( and of course learn to love one another either romantically or not ) new souls who do n’t get memories of past lives because they do n’t have one and panic muggles / people without powers who of course ca n’t get them upgraded or unlocked combination aus : the one where you one or both of you have to do all three ( see your soulmate(s ) , touch your soulmate(s ) , hear your soulmate(s ) ) , or all three have to happen at least once between the 2 + of you or it ’s completely random how you find your soulmate(s ) : one of you gets a name and the other gets a fingerprint , one of you has to hear your soulmate and one of you has to see them , etc ; particularly useful if you happen to be blind or deaf same for characters with other disabilities / who have “ complications ” : they get or find a different way of finding their soulmates , not better or worse , just different then there ’s soulmate aus that do n’t have to conform to lifelong monogamy : the ones where you have more than one romantic soulmate at the same time or you get a new soulmate after the first dies the ones where people have multiple soulmates of different types and it ’s color coded ; a red name / mark / etc for love , a blue one for friendship , etc ; for the ones where you start seeing color you get a new one for each soulmate the ones where some people have romantic soulmates and some do n’t , and those that do n’t are still perfectly happy anyway , maybe in a relationship anyway , maybe not the ones where some people have multiple romantic soulmates who may or may not also be soulmates with each other aromantic or asexual people who have soulmates who are not and they manage to work it out romantic and sexual people who do n’t have soulmates but find happiness anyway , either with someone like them or someone not like them soulmate aus that explore the ramifications of soulmates being a thing : the ones where soulmates are for everyone and get legal aid to help stay together , like if their in - laws try to keep them apart / someone risks getting deported / someone gets drafted / whatever the ones where soulmates are super super rare and technically get exempted from shitty things like “ people of different races / the same sex / etc ca n’t get married / have relations / etc ” but maybe still face a lot of prejudice and they fight to get those types of awful laws lifted for everyone agencies that exist to help you find your soulmate(s ) or   figure out which soulmate thing you have   but some of them are just shams , bonus points for this being in a verse where the thing is exceedingly rare to begin with people pretending to be soulmates to take advantage of the laws , for good or ill ; the couple who loves just as fiercely as a soulmates who will do anything to stay together , or the shitty people who try to claim they ’re mated to people who ’ve rejected them so they “ have ” to stay together tabloid mags photoshopping matching soulmate marks or following big legal cases where someone tries to prove or disprove that they are soulmates with someone else soulmates in universes where they ’re a rarity or rare soulmate types like ot3s / ot4s / otmores in dodging government officials because they do n’t want to become lab rats people who do n’t believe in soulmates until it happens to them , or people who believe hardcore and want to find theirs but they do n’t necessarily have one , or do n’t have a romantic one little rituals that make finding your soulmate more likely , like shaking hands with people as often as possible even with the cashier ringing up your groceries , repeating each other ’s names after you ’re introduced , etc just give me alllll the soulmate aus ok , give me people finding each other in spite of complications , give me all the delightful plot twists , give me detailed worlds where this changes the norms , give me it working out in the end whether romantically or not , bonded or not feel free to reblog with sources ! ( or more aus . ) a little over half of these are things i ’ve seen elsewhere over time and i can not remember where they are all from haha or if you ’re into this sorta thing    you could just take pity on me and reblog it anyway this took an embarrassingly long time to type up oh my god ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;</td>\n",

( mobile and tablet users please see the ending notes)’ in html mode in ao3 , ( if you try this in rich text mode you will get a horrible mess so do n’t ) the line with this example would appear as : &lt; p&gt;“&lt;em &gt; qu’est ce que tu veux?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p &gt; to add the floating box with the translation , you would select the words to be translated ( that is , qu’est ce que tu veux ? ) and paste in the following html . &lt; span title=“what do you want?”&gt;qu’est ce que tu veux?&lt;/span &gt; the whole line will now read : &lt; p&gt;“&lt;em &gt; &lt; span title=“what do you want?”&gt;qu’est ce que tu veux?&lt;/span &gt; &lt; /em&gt;”&lt;/p &gt; review your work , hover over the part that requires translating , and you should see the following : and you ’re done ! i tend to set up a word doc with all the &lt; span &gt; lines i want to use created in it , and then when the time comes , just copy / paste them into ao3 . saves lots of time ! @yellowflicker09011996 relevaaaaaaaant ! ! ! !</td>\n",

       "      <td>3rdgymbros : a / n : okay , so this fanfiction of lou and alabaster ( being bros ) is dedicated to @alexfierrno who has always been very kind , loving and supportive to everyone . i really appreciate you replying to every single one of my messages , and thank you for making my time at tumblr such a bright and positive experience . lou ’s grown used to not having her brother around , but every now and then , she ’ll be reminded of what she had and what they could have been . posted on ao3 and fanfiction.net lou ellen sprinted ahead of alabaster , across the park to the playground and immediately swarmed up the cone - shaped rope climbing frame . alabaster followed through the gate , found the nearest bench and sat down . he checked his watch , but it was n’t time to head back to camp yet . “ see , alabaster , i can do this one too ! ” lou called to him , hanging off the pinnacle and waving . alabaster waved back . at the age of twelve , alabaster considered himself too old to be swinging about on monkey bars , but he had n’t really minded when lou had clamored to visit a playground . ( ethan had snickered and called him whipped , and alabaster had glared , but had been unable to come up with a suitable retort . ) she ’d dragged him half - way across new york to her desired destination , excitedly chattering about the long , curved slides and the wooden playground structure made to look like a pirate ship , complete with a plank and a billowing black flag , adorned with the iconic skull and cross - bones . the heavy grey skies meant that the play park was devoid of other children , although some hardy souls were playing football in the adjoining field . “ you ’re not watching ! ” “ sorry , lou . ” he offered lou a faint smile , watching his younger sister , who was now trying to balance on one foot on the slender rope , the toes of her other foot pointed like a ballerina ’s . “ be careful , okay ? ” “ do n’t worry , i can fly ! ” but you ca n’t , alabaster thought , halfway off the bench , poised to run and catch lou if she fell . lou put both her feet back on the rope and he sat back down on the bench , heaving a silent sigh of relief . “ watch this ! ” “ okay . ” “ look , no hands ! whoops ! ” instinctively , he was off the bench again , but lou managed to catch herself . lou threw her head back and laughed , thrilled , alabaster much less so . he debated calling ethan for back - up , but the son of nemesis would probably laugh at him and encourage lou for good measure . alabaster settled for calling out a warning instead . “ lou , be careful ! ” “ i am ! ” her response elicited an incredulous stare from him , to which lou smiled innocently , looking as though butter would n’t melt in her mouth . alabaster stifled a groan . he had nectar and ambrosia in his pack , but he ’d prefer to have a whole day pass without having to use it for a change . “ lou . ” “ okay , okay ! ” on the climbing frame , lou was pushing her feet one way on the rope and her hands the other way on the central pole , making the cone spin on its axis . her entire attention was on going as fast as possible . chocolate brown curls tumbled around her face and her dull green jacket was half open . deciding that the frame was spinning as fast as possible , lou scrambled down and jumped off . she landed with a happy whoosh , sure on both feet , and ran to the swings . soon , lou ’s shrieks of happiness reached alabaster ’s ears . his shoulders relaxed and his soul smiled . it was so rare that lou got to act like a normal child , running and laughing like an average seven - year old , without the world resting on those slender shoulders for a change . he ’d tried to shield her from some of the more cruel taunts – “ freak ” , “ witch ” – but there was only so much he could do . some of the kids at camp could be cruel , especially when lou , still unable to control her own magic , had accidentally turned some of them into frogs and polecats . the campers – even their own cabin mates – had given lou a wide berth after that . they ’d avoided her as though she were contagious . so much for family loyalty . lou did n’t let it bother her for the most part , but there were the bad days when she would cry , quiet and heartbreaking sniffles into her pillow at night when all the hushed whispers and giggles had faded away . those were the nights when he would crawl into her single bed and stroke her hair until she fell asleep , sobs ebbing away into quiet inhales and exhales . when he would think about how twisted the gods were , to so callously ignore one of their blatantly unhappy children . if they really were all - knowing and all - seeing , could n’t they at least spend five minutes comforting a crying child ? sometimes , alabaster wondered who the real monsters were . “ alabaster ! ” panting , lou came running up from the swings , her curls bouncing , face flushed and eyes bright . “ do you have my water bottle ? ” he forced a smile , aware of keen emerald eyes trained onto his face . alabaster produced it . lou took a long drink , wiping her mouth on her sleeve when she was done . “ not on your sleeve , please , lou , ” alabaster chided gently , wiping that round and damp face with a clean handkerchief . lou pulled a face , but obliged . she handed the bottle and the cap back to him separately . “ come and push me , ” she said , and sprinted back to the swings . alabaster got up to join her . “ lou ellen ? ” that ’s not alabaster . her name is accompanied with a hesitant poke to her forearm . lou ellen wakes with a start , feeling rough bark press into her spine . she ’s crying . lou ellen ’s head is turned to the side , her long lashes forming dark crescents , but the hot tears push through unrelentingly . she touches a cheek that is glistening wet and in her mind comes a refrain that sounds eerily like alabaster ’s voice : do n’t cry , lou . do n’t cry . please do n’t cry . everything ’s going to be okay . lou ellen looks up at nico and hazel , their faces identical pictures of concern . for a moment she flashes back to alabaster . she looks nico in the eyes and for a minute , has difficulty focusing . “ yes ? ” “ you fell asleep . it ’s time for dinner . ” “ okay . ” hazel ’s eyes slide from nico to lou ellen as she speaks . “ you ’re crying . ” “ okay . ” “ we ’ll see you at the dining pavilion ? ” hazel ’s smiling , but there ’s a hint of uncertainty in her voice . “ we could save you a seat . ” “ okay . ” lou ellen watches them walk away , hand - in - hand down the gravel path with its russet - colored trees . hazel ’s wearing a skirt in some kind of pale , floaty material , and her purple spqr t - shirt . she ’s talking to nico , and her face is tilted up to his . nico cracks a rare smile as he bends down to listen . the effect is a kodak moment , filled with love and joy , and happiness . lou ellen feels as though she ’s been punched in the gut . she ’d been like that too , once upon a time . “ i ’m your big brother now . that means we ’re family . and we ’re all going to stick together . ” “ forever and ever ? ” “ forever and ever . ” i had a brother , she thinks , in something akin to a mingled sense of jealousy and despair . i had a brother , but he was taken away . lou ellen closes her eyes . she has a blinding headache .</td>\n",

       "      <td>from heaven and back : chapter 2 chapter one here rainy days were some of the best days , at least in marinette ’s mind . there was nothing like watching the city get a good shower . the rain washed away dirt and grime , much like ladybug ’s lucky charm cleansed the city after an akuma attack . the smell of fresh rain was so pure and refreshing . there was also the fact that marinette fell head - over - heals for adrien on a rainy day . just the smell of rain brought the memories fresh to her mind . the way their hands had brushed when she reached for his umbrella . the way his laugh sent chills down her spine . the familiar feeling that spread across her chest . marinette felt like she already knew him . “ marinette ? ” a small voice sounded , pulling the girl from her thoughts . she looked away from her bedroom window to see tikki , her faithful kawami , hovering near her shoulder . “ what is it tikki ? ” marinette questioned . “ do n’t you think we should hurry up ? ” the pixie flew over to the girl ’s phone and tapped it . “ we do n’t want you to be later than we already are . ladybug ca n’t be grounded . ” marinette rushed over , taking the phone and bringing it close to her face . “ what ! ” the girl shouted in panic . “ is it already that late ? argh ! ” she dashed over to her desk and began throwing stuff into her bag . “ just once , i ’d like not to be rushed ! is that too much to ask for ? ” the girl looked to her kawami for an answer but all she got was an unsympathetic giggle . marinette groaned , slinging her bag over her shoulder . “ come on tikki ! we got ta go ! ” marinette paused only long enough for the pixie to fly inside her bag . flinging open the trap door she took the stairs down two by two . “ wait ! marine … ” vipp thump thump thump “ ow … . ” marinette groaned . her body cried out in pain as she pushed herself up from the floor . the pixie sighed . “ i ’m sorry marinette . i tried to warn you . ” “ thanks , tikki . i appreciate the effort . ” the poor girl moaned , forced herself up and hobbled out the door , rubbing her bruises along the way . adrien watched the rain as it drizzled down the car window on his way to school . he was about a half hour late because of a photo shoot . the rhythm of the rain falling was depressing . adrien felt like he had a huge cloud of gloom above his head . rainy days were n’t adrien ’s favorite . one of the side effects of being chat noir is that the rain made him feel lazy and unfocused . but it was more than that . rainy days held mixed feelings for the poor sunshine child . adrien ’s mother had disappeared on a rainy day . she had kissed his head affectionately right before his morning lessons . as she left for a meeting it started to rain . adrien did n’t think anything of it , till she never came home . ever since that day , the rain weighed heavily on his heart . though , it was also the rain that made him think of marinette . how they became friends . how she had made him laugh . he had n’t laughed like that in so long . her laugh had resonated through him like a wave . it chased away the sadness and uncertainty that held so tightly to him . marinette made him feel confident . she seemed so familiar and safe . “ hey , kid . you still with me ? ” the blonde jumped at the muffled voice coming from his jacket . adrien opened his jacket slightly , peering at the small flying cat inside . “ yeah plagg , i ’m here . what ’s up ? ” “ were you having another ladybug daydream ? ” the kawami asked with a mischievous look . “ what ? no ! ” adrien exclaimed ! his cheeks flushed red at the mention of his polka - dotted love . the flying cat cocked an eyebrow skeptically . “ ahuh , sure you were n’t . ” plagg left the confines of the jacket to hover in front of the flustered boy . “ you have that look again . ” “ what look ? ” “ you always make this twitterpated look when you ’re thinking about ladybug . it ’s painful just watching you make it . ” the black pixie held his head dramatically as he spoke . “ i do n’t know what you ’re talking about . and for your information , i was thinking about marinette , not ladybug ! so ha ! ” adrien smirked , crossing his arms triumphantly . he ’d won this argument . plagg just closed his eyes and shook his head . ‘ these dumb kids are gunna’ drive me crazy ! just how thick can they be?’ he internally complained . “ what ? ” adrien asked as the car slowed to a halt . “ nothing . just do n’t let me get wet ! ” plagg hissed and flew back into adrien ’s jacket . adrien could n’t help but feel like he was missing something . but he would have to figure that out later . he was already late . adrien grabbed his bag and umbrella and slipped out of the car . he gave his driver a wave and the man drove away . the boy began making his way to the school . honk honk honk the blonde jumped at the sounds of a car horn . adrien turned to face the sound . he discarded his bag and umbrella making him ready to run and transform in an instant . what he was not ready for was something to hit him square in the chest . “ oomph . ” was the sound that escaped adrien ’s lungs as he hit the wet cement . his back cried out in agony . his head spun like an old record . it was his lungs that hurt the worst . they felt flat like there was an extra weight pushing down on them . adrien wheezed slightly . man , it never hurt this bad when he was wearing chat ’s suit . after a few seconds , adrien gathered the strength to prop himself up on his elbows . he looked down at his chest . he saw hair … black hair … it looked kinda’ like … ladybug ’s ! adrien ’s eyes widened . could it be her ? he blushed . plagg was right , he really was twitterpated . “ ug … ” the girl whimpered , slowly rising to her hands and knees . adrien held his breath . the girl looked up , eyes meeting his . “ ma … marinette ? ” adrien was surprised to say the least . it was not his lady , but someone just as sweet , who had run into him . he coughed , clearing his throat . “ marinette ! are you okay ? ” marinette was not okay . she was having an internal meltdown ! she had just run into adrien agreste ! sure she had missed the car , thanks to her ladybug skills , but she had run smack dab into adrien ! and to make matters worse , she ’d fallen on top of him ! on top ! what idiot had condemned her to this horrible fate ? who ever thought ‘ oh , i ’m going to make marinette a clumsy prone girl with an overactive emotional state.’ was an idiot ! “ marinette ? ” adrien called waving a hand in front of her face . “ can you hear me ? ” “ huh ? what ? ” marinette came back to the real world . she had been staring into space . adrien head called her name several times to no avail . not even the rain soaking them was enough to bring her too . it was adrien ’s touch that got her attention . adrien had sat up and now had both his hands on marinette ’s shoulders . he ’d maneuvered her to sit on her own bent legs . he was studying her critically , a single eyebrow raised in concern . “ i asked you how you were feeling ? that was a pretty rough landing . ” adrien ’s hands slowly slipped from marinette ’s shoulders as he spoke . marinette ’s blush deepened . he was so close to her . she could see the intensity in his eyes . it reminded her of a certain black cat she knew . “ oh , i ’m not sane . ” marinette smiled . it was n’t till adrien ’s look grew more worried that she realized her mistake . marinette began rushing words out as fast as she could , her hands moving wildly as she spoke . “ i mean not in pain ! because - i’m - sane ! well - most - of - the - time - but - that - doesn’t - matter - right - now - because - i’m - sane - and - not - in - pain - and - you - don’t - need - to - worry - about - me ! hehehe … ” there was an awkward silence between the two teens . adrien was staring at marinette with a bewildered look . marinette was internally screaming at herself for messing up in front of adrien , again ! it was adrien who broke the uneasy silence by chuckling . “ marinette , you have to be one of the funniest people i ’ve ever met ! ” “ re .. really ? ” the embarrassed girl was taken aback . she knew adrien was the kindest boy she ’d ever met , but he still managed to amazer her . “ really ! ” adrien smiled at her , the same smile he ’d given her when they ’d first become friends . “ you ’re hiss - terical ! ” marinette was shocked ! did adrien agrest just use a patented chat noir pun ? “ i did n’t know you … um , were a fan of chat noir ’s puns … ” “ what ? ” adrien jumped slightly at the mention of chat noir . “ you … um … you just used a chat pun . ” “ i did ? ” “ uh - huh . you said ' hiss - terical’ . ” marinette naturally did chat ’s mannerisms as she purred the pun . “ o … or … something like that … ” adrien blushed . he was flattered that she knew his super hero persona so well after only a few encounters . she had his mannerisms down to an art . now if she just took some punning lessons , from your ’s truly , she would n’t make a half - bad chat noir . adrien smiled . not that he would ever give up his miraculous . “ huh , i guess i did . he must have infected me or something . ” adrien rubbed the back of his head nervously . he had to be more careful or he ’d be found out . then ladybug would have his tail . “ yeah , he does tend to have that kind of effect . ” marinette giggled slightly . “ we , uh , should head inside . we do n’t want to catch a cold . ” the rain was really starting to soak adrien ’s hair and clothes .    plagg would certainly have words to say about this later . the blonde looked over to see marinette was in the same boat . “ oh , yeah . we should . ” adrien stood up and offered his hand to marinette . she took it hesitantly and he pulled her up . he held her hand just a little bit longer than he needed too , though neither of the teens seemed to mind . “ th … thank you … ” marinette stuttered as he let go of her hand . both teens gathered their things . adrien grabbed his umbrella and dumped out the pool of water that was forming in it . he shook it out and brought it over to cover both marinette and himself . “ shall we ? ” the blonde asked . marinette just nodded in response . she was far too nervous to actually speak . they began making their way up the steps walking in sync with each other and the rain marinette walked rigidly as she tried not to invade adrien ’s personal space . adrien was way more relaxed as they walked . they had almost reached the large door when adrien looked down to see his shadow . “ hmm ? ” he hummed . where there was a shadow there was light . the boy turned around peering at the rainy city scape . “ wow ! hey marinette , look ! ” marinette turned around and let out a small gasp . “ it ’s beautiful ! ” the two watched as the clouds parted and a rainbow fell down from the sky . it painted itself perfectly across the city , landing right at the base of the eiffel tower . it was breathtaking , like something out of a fairytale . adrien stole a side glance at his friend . she wore a look of pure awe that made his heart skip a beat . for just a second , he thought he ’d seen ladybug . adrien shook his head . he was about to look away when something made him look closer . there , in marinette ’s eyes was a rainbow . how was that even possible ? “ it .. it ’s pretty … do n’t you think ? ” marinette turned to look at adrien , she was blushing which somehow made the rainbow in her eyes grow brighter . adrien felt his chest constrict . “ yeah , it ’s amazing . ” kell , kell , kell the school bell rang , meaning there was only fifteen minutes left in class . “ what ? ” the two teens exclaimed in unison . both turned and began sprinting for their classroom “ we ’re late ! ” marinette cried . “ i think you mean , later than we were . ” adrien corrected . “ not to mention , we ’re sopping wet . ” marinette let out an exasperated sigh . this was going to be fun to try and explain . meanwhile , up in the waiting room . “ i ca n’t believe you did that . ” the boy stated flatly shaking his head . “ what do you mean ? ” the girl cocked her head to the side innocently as she finished closing the clouds back up . “ you made a rainbow , for one thing . ” the blonde began counting on his fingers , a deadpan look on his face . “ then you took it further by reflecting it off her eyes like that . and you were the one who made that girl slip in the first place . are you trying to get us demoted ? ” “ i ’m quite sure i do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ” the girl leaned close to her partner letting her eyes flutter a bit to play up her innocence . “ look , brie ” the boy put a hand on her shoulder and sighed . “ we ’re guardian angels . not cupid . ” the girl smirked up at her partner mischievously . “ you have n’t used that nickname in a while . was it seeing plagg that reminded you of it ? ” the boy turned away from the girl in an attempt to hide the blush creeping onto his cheeks . “ do n’t change the subject . ” his partner just giggled and hugged him from behind . “ i love you too , fe . ” thank you so much for reading ! ! : d i hope you enjoyed my little chapter for adrienette month ! ! you can also find this on ff.net here .</td>\n",

       "      <td>missafairy : memcjo : dettiot : fallingmeleth : adiwriting : barbex : inkshaming : so , i posted a fic today , and as i was setting up the ao3 post , i found myself writing in the end notes an impassioned - almost desperate , ngl - plea for comments . for interaction . and yeah , for validation too . because you know what ? writing is hard - despite commonly held misconceptions , it takes a shit - ton of effort to take some blank , empty void of a page and fill it with something   that lives and breathes and touches the minds and hearts of others .      and do n’t you dare wave that   “ you should be writing for yourself ” bullshit in my face . it ’s been a long , long time since i ’ve been able to do that , and honestly i ’m glad managed to recover as much as i have and write as much as i do . having an audience is an integral part of the writing process . let me repeat that . having an audience is an integral part of the writing process . we fanfic authors do n’t ask for much . as someone who is a published author , who has been published in a real physical book ™ and was paid hundreds of dollars in honest - to - god cold - hard cash for less work than i put into my fanfic , let me tell you , a few comments will not pay my tuition or buy my groceries or put clothes on my back . compared to the hours of labor that went into earning the money i was paid with , comments take substantially less time to create . and yet , to us , they are priceless . authors will create entire worlds for the sake of making a single person smile . you can be that person . we will write for you happily . you just have to let us know you care . and you ’d better do it soon . i ’ve heard too many authors all too willing to pull their tumblrs and erase or abandon their fics on ao3 because they have grown weary of screaming into the void . that fanfic you love ? gone . that chapter you ’re waiting for ? never gon na happen . how many of you have bookmark lists with fics already missing ? i bet you wo n’t even remember which one it is . you can keep that from happening . just write   “ omg thank you for updating , i really liked _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ! ” and fill in the blank . someone worked hard to put that smile on your face . you can make them smile in return . “ and do n’t you dare wave that “ you should be writing for yourself ” bullshit in my face . “ this so fucking much ! ! writers write to be read ! writers write to be read . oh my god , yes . because i ’ve heard far too many authors over the last few months talk about quitting writing over poor response ( or even worse- flaming ) . coming from an avid reader who was used to books and to not have anywhere to answer to the author , i ’m trying to get better at reviewing . but i do have a question for the authors :) . and it ’s a genuine one , no sarcasm or attack here . what kind of review do you like the most ? what motivates you more ? i ’ve heard some say they do n’t really like the   “ love it . please update soon ” generic one so i wondered since sometimes i ’m not sure what to say except   “ that was great . i loved it : ) ” . “ that was great . i loved it ” is fantastic , really .   if that ’s all you want to say , that works !   that tells me you enjoyed it .      if there was any bit that made you laugh out loud , or want to throw something at the screen , or you had to step back and take a break because you were just having all the feels – tell me that !   i think all authors loved knowing that our story matters to you – that it was n’t something you just skimmed while waiting to pick up your kids or at the doctor ’s office .   but even if you skimmed it , just saying   “ great job ! ” or   “ thanks for a great read ! ” makes an author ’s day . i admit , having the comment solely be   “ update soon ! ” is infuriating to me .   because i just posted .   like , even when i have a cushion of already - finished chapters , it ’s infuriating to me , because it makes me feel like i ’m a performing monkey . but other than this , pretty much any expression of enjoyment over my fics is fantastic .   :-) they do this for free you'all ! say thank you ! yeah , it ’s very sad :( i do n’t know if my fic is this bad or people just do n’t leave comments …        @ inkshaming    i do n’t know which fandom you write for since i do only arrow but please put up some links to your stories .   i know i will be happy to share them and i will go read your stories and post comments even if they are not arrow .   us writers need to stick together .</td>\n",

” chat squints as he follows her gaze , and shakes his head when he ca n’t seem to make it out either . “ it should n’t be that dark . ”    “ it ’s not dark , exactly , but … ” she trails off , leaning forward slightly . her foot slips on the edge and she finds herself shooting forward , hands flailing and her yo - yo quickly unwinding before she can grab some of its slack .    chat shouts and launches himself after her . she feels his ribs crash against hers , the metal of his staff pressing between them as he pushes against it . he stumbles as he lands back on the edge , his arm gripped tightly across her waist . his breath fans across her face , hot and uneven , and he looks as if he ’ll be the next to topple off the edge . “ nice save , ” she says , frowning up at him . “ you okay ? ” “ i think i ’m too old for this , ” he wheezes . his grip loosens and he leans against her instead , shaking feeling back into his legs .    “ i think we ’re just out of practice . ” she presses a palm to his forehead , frowning more when she finds it burning up . “ and you ’re definitely not in the right shape for this . ”    “ i ’m fine . ” he grabs hold of her hand and squeezes it gently . “ getting over a nasty virus . overworked . stressed . i ’ll be good as new tomorrow . ”    “ well , that does n’t help me tonight , ” she says , squeezing his hand in return .    he presses another quick kiss to her knuckles . “ ah , your concern humbles me , my lady . but i think we have more pressing matters right meow . ”    she yanks her hand free . “ you ’d think after thirteen years , you ’d at least have better puns . ” “ what are you saying ? ” he raises in eyebrow in mock disbelief . “ my puns are ameowzing . ”    “ even worse , actually . ”    “ i ’m out of practice , ” he reminds her and leans against his staff . “ so , what do you think that shadowy area is ? ” “ i do n’t know . ” her gaze flicks back towards the dark patch in the horizon . “ it looks foggy , misshapen almost . definitely strange . ” “ so , let ’s investigate . ” he ’s already leaping past her , tail flying behind him , before she can register he ’s left . “ a warning would have been nice , ” she mutters . she flings her yo - yo at the building below , swinging after him .    the shadows do n’t clear as they near closer . their shape is just as distorted when they ’re up close , dark patches weaving in and out of focus .    “ i ’ve seen this before , ” she says slowly . she thinks of the shadows that edge her dreams sometimes , vaguely - shaped , always reaching .    chat pokes at the shadow with his staff . it passes straight through , even though the shadow is n’t transparent . “ it ’s all over this building , ” he observes . “ this whole row of buildings , actually . what did this used to be , an old business area ? ”    “ i ca n’t remember , ” she replies . “ it ’s been a while since i ’ve been home . i was too busy trying to keep afloat in new york . ” “ new york ? ” he seems surprised , chuckling as he retracts his staff and returns it to his side . “ what kind of heathen did they turn you into ? ”    she scoffs , flicking her yo - yo in his direction as she paces around the shadow surrounding them . “ certainly more refined than you turned out . you ’re barely more than skin and bones , you scrawny cat . ”    his smile fades . “ i ’ve been doing some traveling of my own . it did n’t turn out as well as yours . ” “ i can see that . ” she does n’t meet his gaze when he continues to stare down at her , the humor stripped from their banter , the shadows like dark clouds smothering their feet . they remind her entirely too much of her dream . “ we can go through it , i think . it does n’t seem harmful . ”    his hand stills her before she can test her theory . “ you do n’t know that . not all wounds are visible . ”    “ you have any other ideas ? ” “ not at the — ladybug , wait ! ”    but she ’s already passed through , the air stale and heavy around her . chat ’s voice is muffled behind her , as if there ’s a slate of glass between them . the building around her looks considerably more rotted than the outside ’s implied . the second floor is crumbling away , wooden support beams eroded and broken above her . there are streaks like burn marks across the walls . chunks of floor missing , dirt and rubble poking through . and the shadows hover like low - laying fog at her feet .    “ not impressed , ” chat says from behind her . he waves at the fog behind him , which seems to have risen to block out the city around them .    “ sorry for disappointing . ” she bends over to inspect a black streak winding down the decaying staircase . “ you said you ’ve seen this before , ” he points out . his steps are slow behind her . “ no . ” she runs a gloved finger across the blackened mark . she ’d expected soot to come free , but the blackness parts away from the stairs , drifting like smoke before dissipating . “ i mean , not exactly . ” “ it ’s like a dream , ” he says and the words startle her . she turns towards him , the grim line of his frown pulling at something familiar , something she ca n’t quite pinpoint . “ you ’ve dreamt this ? ” he lets out a low laugh and kicks at a piece of broken tile . “ since i was eighteen . same recurring dream , every night . ”    “ every night ? ” “ every night , ” he confirms . “ it ’s part of the reason why i was traveling . trying to find answers . ” “ did you see— ” “ a ghost ? ” he interrupts , standing stock - still as his eyes fix on something past her .    “ yes , exactly , ” she says . she feels her heart speed up , her blood both too warm and too cold in her fingers . “ no , ” he whispers , nodding slightly to what his gaze is fixed on . “ turn slowly and back up towards me . ” a shiver runs through her as she turns . his hand finds her , pulling her behind him , as she eyes the figure standing on the stairs . it ’s a woman , clad in a white pantsuit , her hair swept up neatly at the nape of her neck . but she ’s entirely transparent , made of nothing but white smoke that stands out starkly from the dark shadows surrounding her .    “ how do we fight ghosts ? ” he asks quietly , his staff held before him .    “ no idea , ” she replies , recalling tikki ’s words from earlier . her fingers edge towards her yo - yo , ready to use her lucky charm .    then , the woman screams , gray smoke pouring from her mouth as she dissolves before them , leaving the staircase bare again . both chat and ladybug jump back , shouting , but the shadows are already reeling away , fading into the walls .    there ’s something entirely too familiar about the woman , whose lectures marinette had n’t attended for many years .    “ was that … i mean , did you recognize her ? ” she asks . there ’s a beat of silence and she turns to look back at chat , who ’s swallowing visibly . “ i did , ” he finally says . his hand is still around her wrist and he lets go slowly . there ’s something both jarring and relieving to hear him confirming her fear .    “ so , is this something that mimics people ? imitates their shape , maybe ? should we be hunting down who they ’re targeting ? to ensure their safety ? ”    “ it could be , ” he says slowly , “ but miss bustier passed away a few years ago . ” she feels her blood run cold again . “ no , that ca n’t be . ” but she was younger than my mother . she reels back in her mind , trying to remember if someone had mentioned it to her . her parents . alya . maybe they ’d thought she ’d been too busy , maybe they ’d thought they ’d told her in passing — a skype or phone call before she ’d run off to chase after deadlines . maybe they had and she ’d buried it in the trenches of her memory , something to deal with later .    “ i had her one year . ” the words slide free , like an afterthought . it takes a moment for them to catch up to her and when they do , her eyes widen in panic . she clears her throat . “ i mean i— ”    “ i did , too , ” he replies . she glances up at him , but he ’s still staring at the staircase , lost in thought . he has n’t moved since the ghostly figure had disappeared .    “ we went to the same school , ” she says . the jarring sense tugs at her tighter . his head jerks toward her , eyes wide as he lets out a low chuckle . “ we really are out of practice , letting things like that slip . ”    she watches him run a hand through his hair , sending it tumbling past his eyes . she tries to recall someone tousling his hair similarly , but stops herself before she can fully dissect it . she ’d gone thirteen years without knowing his identity . she does n’t need to know now , not when there are more important matters .    “ how do we fight ghosts ? ” she repeats his earlier question . “ i do n’t know , but i have a feeling that wherever it ’s gone , it ’ll lead to the other ladybug and chat noir . ” “ practically a given , ” she agrees . “ the question is where . ”    a shrill beep sounds between them , startling more space between them .    “ time ’s running out , ” he says . “ should we come back ? ” she eyes the fog , almost entirely dissipated now . the decrepit building seems emptier around them now , as if whatever eeriness it held retreated with the shadows . it ’s nothing but forgotten debris now . “ i do n’t think we ’ll find any answers tonight . ”    her miraculous beeps a second time .    “ no , probably not . ” his eyes flick towards her , a smile at the edge of his lips . it has none of the fervor of his previous smiles . “ tomorrow ? ” “ unless you see something before then . ”    he bows , and the way his body seems to fold on itself makes the jarring even worse .    “ take care of yourself , ” she murmurs , barely catching the furrow of his brow as she tosses her yo - yo and takes flight again . does your boyfriend know you ’ve got a handsome partner fighting crime with you ? chat had said , collapsing his staff and returning it to his side . he cocked a grin in her direction .    she ’d immediately rolled her eyes . i do n’t think he has any competition .    me - ouch . he leaned against the wall , grin never faltering .    do you think your girlfriend would appreciate you flirting with another girl ? she ’d tossed back . this time , his grin did waver . it ’s just banter . you know i ’m not serious , right ? she ’d paused , arms folded across her chest as she took in his frown . his quips had come in less succession those days , less admiring , more vague .    if it ’s bothering you , i ’ll stop , he ’d continued . i ’m not trying to make you uncomfortable . it was strange , she thought , how the dynamic had changed between them , subtle only until they drew attention to it . how everything had to be drawn into boundaries , painted over in red lines . she ’d always had to ask herself would adrien be okay with this ? with this ? as if she could conjure him beside her and have him tell her how to act around chat . and then , she ’d wonder why she would have to examine it at all . do n’t worry about it , she ’d said , wishing more than anything her miraculous would call the night to an end . the way he looked at her made her feel anything but comfortable .</td>\n",

( months / years ) : if you want to be very technical , probably 13ish years . platforms you ’ve used : pencil and paper , forums , livejournal , aim , e - mail , skype , tumblr , telegram , discord . best experience :   eh , this feels a little unfair , but i really , really   love to write plotty shippy things , and so far my best experiences have been via e - mail with a longtime trusted friend . we wrote something like 21 different rps together in less than a year ( some as long as 300,000 words long … ) . we even rewrote one from the ground up when we decided we did n’t like the first one enough . and honestly ? it was so much fun . there ’s nothing at all wrong with being here for fun or attention , but i ’m here because writing is a lifelong passion of mine , and boy did it feel great to rp with someone who was as seriously invested in our rps as i was . plus , there was n’t that pressure that existed on tumblr of knowing people might be reading your thread and feeling your wording has to be perfect . heh . that said , so far this fandom has probably been my best tumblr rp experience , so that ’s good ! i ’ve met some great people here already . 4 . muse preferences female or male : i ’ve actually rp’d a pretty even 50/50 split , but i do prefer female muses . multi or single :   i ’m one of those tiresome old - school otpers who stand by the old definition of the phrase   “ one true pairing ” which is to say : i tend to ship one thing and stick to it . of course , according to rp rules and regulations i ’m multiship because you never know , and honestly gimme all the looker blogs i mean what haha i ’m not trash /sweats nervously 5 . writing preferences fluff , angst , or smut : all of the above , but i ’ll only write smut with someone i feel really comfortable with . that said , i like fluff and angst a whole lot , but they have to make sense and be in - character for me to enjoy them . sad shit for the sake of making the characters sad does n’t really fly with me .    plots or memes : plots , but i like memes , too , and sometimes they can grow plots and walk … long or short replies : honestly , both in the same thread is fine by me . it keeps the thread interesting / dynamic by letting things flow faster when they should be moving faster – kind of like writing a piece of fiction .    best time to write : this time of year i tend to get a lot done at work since my job is super busy in the spring / summer / fall and pretty dead in winter ; also , there are a lot of distractions at home sometimes . late at night is my worst time to write , though . i ’m pretty flexible work schedule wise , but i work an early shift so i ’m kind of a morning person these days . are you like your muse(s ) ? i ’m not much of a fan of this question , mostly because it ’s sort - of asking people to admit how much of themselves they ’ve sunk into their muse – something all writers do to an extent , but which most of us are n’t really willing to admit to doing , not in exacting detail , anyway . that said : yes . i am quite a bit like the version of anabel i ’ve chosen to portray , at least in terms of personality . looks - wise , anabel kicks my ass . i am , unfortunately , something like a gremlin . tagged by :    @sharplydressed - rockcollector tagging : @balsamina , @secret - agent - man - looker , @kahunacop , @moonkxssed .</td>\n",

” “ excuse me ? ” maeve walked alongside di josh derwent , praying that he would n’t say something that only he thought was clever . fat chance . “ you ’re with your people . ” he said it matter - of - factly and with a smirk . an annoying combination . if side - eye could kill , maeve should have arrested herself for murder right then and there . instead she took a deep breath and concentrated on following the person ahead of them , detective cassie maddox . but all the while , she could n’t help but think that derwent was n’t entirely wrong . it was just the way in which he said it , to get a reaction out of her , that was so irritating . she should n’t have been surprised though . the irish cracks had n’t stopped from the minute their plane landed .    the two london detectives were in dublin where they had been dispatched on special assignment . they were teaming up with the local murder squad on a case that had ties to one that they were currently investigating back in england . cassie led them down the hallway until they reached the main squad room . she quickly got everyone ’s attention and started a brief round of introductions . a less than enthused audience greeted maeve and derwent . when cassie finished and stepped aside to let derwent take the floor , he winked at her . “ thanks , sweetheart . ” cassie crossed her arms and offered him only a deadpan stare in return . she had already proven herself to be completely immune to derwent ’s special brand of charm from the moment they met . derwent marched to the center of the room while maeve silently repeated to herself : please do n’t embarrass me . please do n’t embarrass me . please do n’t embarrass me . so much for that . projecting his voice louder than necessary , derwent proceeded to give a rundown of his life ’s achievements . apparently , cassie forgot to include ‘ god ’s gift to mankind’ in her introduction of him . when derwent finished talking himself up , he began to bark out orders and managed to insult the entire dublin police department in the process . working for london ’s finest gave derwent a false sense of superiority . the met this and the met that … “ alright , no more dicking about . it ’s time to get some real work done . ” with that , he turned and briskly headed toward the exit , bumping hard into sam o'neill on the way out .   no acknowledgment and certainly no apology was given to sam . “ what a feckin’ gobshite , ” someone muttered as everyone returned to their usual tasks . cassie was suddenly feeling rather sympathetic toward maeve . “ is he always like that ? ” “ not always . but most of the time . ” she then added quite seriously , “ you ’ll have to forgive him . he was dropped on his head as a child . ” later , after a long day of poring over the case files , cassie and maeve decided to unwind at the local pub . they shared many laughs , mainly at derwent ’s expense . as the night wore on , their conversation turned quiet and contemplative when they commiserated over failed relationships . lesson learned : never sleep with colleagues named rob . both women downed their drinks simultaneously . maeve stared into her empty mug . “ i ’ll never make that mistake again . ” “ you ca n’t let one bad experience put you off . i did n’t . ” maeve turned to cassie . “ sam ? ” cassie ’s tiny smile turned into a full grin . “ i ’m impressed . you are a good detective . ” maeve had noticed the signs earlier . the affectionate teasing and meaningful glances shared when they thought no one else was looking . maeve could tell that sam had an underlying respect for cassie that quite frankly not many men possessed for women in their field . “ congratulations , he seems like a great guy . ” “ so you really would n’t consider another workplace romance ? ” “ i work with derwent , remember ? ” “ you never thought about– ? ” “ absolutely not ! ” that was a lie . but her one moment of weakness at ben and christine ’s wedding was pure stupidity . it did n’t count . and now maeve just desperately wanted to get off this subject . ” he ’s a rude cocky belligerent bastard and he drives me mad ! ” feeling a little guilty about her outburst , she managed to reluctantly add , “ but he is a good copper . ” “ he said the same about you . ” maeve ’s eyebrows went up . shocked was an understatement .   “ he did ? ” cassie nodded . “ while you were in the evidence room , he was bragging about all the tough cases you ’ve solved together . he said that you had all the tools to be a great detective but did n’t know what the fuck to do with them until he came along . now you ’re one of the best thanks to him . ” leave it to derwent to pay her a backhanded compliment . just then , maeve ’s phone chimed and she reached for it to read the incoming text . speak of the devil . where the fuck are you ! technically , it was n’t even a question but she had to answer . ignoring derwent was not an option . as she tapped her reply , maeve could n’t help but smile to herself . i ’m with my people . and for good measure , she added a smiley face emoji which was sure to have derwent seething . feeling happier than she had in quite awhile , maeve asked her new friend , “ how about another round ?

       "      <td>fandomisnotyoursafespace : thebibliosphere : gay - makoto : anakinsbugs : captain - liddy : okay like . supposedly being interested in m / m relationships , or even a specific m / m relationship because you like the specific dynamic depicted is fetishizing . because it ’s only acceptable to take an interest in any m / m relationship if you ’re a man who likes men , apparently . but then also m / f relationships are supposedly relatable and accessible to everybody ? ? ? or maybe . just maybe . that ’s a bullshit argument used to shut down enthusiasm for anything that is n’t heteronormative as well as to shame a group of what is perceived to be young women and girls . because any time young women like anything at all , however harmless or even positive and uplifting , that thing is relentlessly mocked and derided as shallow and ridiculous . this post has so much going on that i guess i got ta write a whole essay so here we go as a gay man , i can say with full and total confidence that more often than not , women ’s consumption of our relationships , and our sex lives , and our trauma is fetishistic . it ’s not about fighting heteronormativity . it ’s really not that deep . finding another man loving man in fandom is incredibly difficult , especially in shipping circles . i ’ve been in the tumblr business for almost seven years , and i ’ve met maybe 1 or 2 guys total who write slash besides me . slash fiction is dominated almost entirely by women and woman - aligned people , and it ’s been this way for a very long time . even a good amount of smutty slash fanzines in the 70s-90s were written by women who liked to write about boys fucking . when i met another guy who wrote slash fanfic , i was completely shocked . it had taken 6 or so years to meet him , and i was completely bowled over . and i just thought “ boys do n’t write about boys loving boys , that ’s not our thing ” . but what i wanna know is why is n’t it our thing ? ? ? why are n’t most slash fanfics written by boys who love boys ? why is n’t a genre , a subculture about us , something that we ’re seemingly not allowed to participate in ? why do we feel like outsiders when writing our own stories ? why are some of them most praised “ gay shows ” and “ gay books ” ( for example , the song of achilles and yuri on ice ) all written by women , and read by women , and are n’t really catered towards gay men at all even though we ’re the subjects of the story . when you go through websites like goodreads and look under the “ gay romance ” section , you see names like madeline , jane , abigail , marie , amy . i mean , abigail roux ’s writing alone probably takes up half the list ! you might see a sean or a david thrown in , but for the most part , stories about men loving each other are written by women . ones that are written by men often do n’t get the attention reigned in by the foxhole court and cut and run . that ’s where the issue lies . in a community supposedly dedicated to us , our love , our sex , our relationships , we take the back seat . we do n’t get recognition . we do n’t get control . we do n’t get to tell our stories our way . not to mention , much of slash has always been smut . and that smut , for a lot of questioning boys who love boys , that ’s our first exposure to sex between two men . i know it was for me . but when it ’s written by someone who ’s never been a man having sex with a man ( and no , if you ’re a cis girl having sex with a cis man is not the same way trans men have sex with cis men , but y'alls abysmal treatment of trans men will have to wait for another post ) , it ’s often written inaccurately and unsafely . not using a condom ? unsafe . spit as lube ? definitely not safe . shoving it in ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? really not safe . rimming someone without having them clean or use an enema first ? ? ? ? not only unsafe , but also really gross . the general consensus ( and yes i asked ) about this is that safe sex has been deemed by slash shippers to be “ boring ” . they want to get right to the fucking , no time for prep ( which is literally the most important part ) , no time for cleaning , no time for lube , no time for protection . this is incredibly dangerous for young men who love men who are trying to figure out all the different ways that we can make love to each other . if this is their only exposure , they ’re going to think that doing this is okay . they ’re going to think “ yeah , i can just shove my tongue into someone ’s dirty asshole ” or “ i do n’t have to prepare my partner before shoving very large into something very tiny ” which is not the case and will get people hurt . i know fic is n’t supposed to be a sex ed class , but the lack of sex safety is really concerning . and when men who love men like myself bring up the fact that maybe you guys should stay in your lane a little and let us take the wheel in a genre entirely dedicated to us having sex with each other , you somehow claim that we are “ kinkshaming ” you and being misogynist by taking away “ the one place where women can explore their kinks without judgement ” . which is complete and total bullshit because first of all gay people are not your kink . we are not your fetish , we do n’t exist for your entertainment or your gratification . if you really think that two men who make love to each other is your “ fetish ” , then maybe that ’s telling you something . human beings are n’t kinks . so fuck outta here with that . and the obsession with boys enduring homophobic and sometimes transphobic abuse and rape for the sake of ~angst~ and hurt / comfort is uh pretty fucked up . the obsession people have with gay trauma is by far the most disturbing of all . like so many woman slash writers go out of their way to subject gbt male characters to all sorts of injury and abuse just so they can be ~comforted~ and possibly get comfort sex . the idea that you want to see us hurt just because you think it ’s cute when we comfort each other is n’t okay . like , did n’t someone want to write a check please fanfic about the pulse shooting ? ? ? yeah how can any of you look at that and think it ’s okay . it ’s not okay . in no world is that okay . so this brings me to your claim that if gay / bi / pan men ( including trans men and male - aligned people ) tell you to maybe chill out and maybe let us write stories about us for a change , that ’s a misogynistic / homophobic / shallow statement . this just blows my mind . i need a little more clarification about why it ’s such an evil no - no for us to want to represent ourselves or speak for ourselves or tell our own stories . because it kinda seems homophobic that you ’re so angry about gbt men wanting to represent themselves . it almost sounds like you only think our love and our sex and our lives exist only for you to write and read about . you ’re making it sound like we are objects made for your consumption , and by establishing ourselves as real people is ruining your fantasy . nobody ’s saying you ca n’t be supportive of gbt boys and want to write about them in your stories . but for the love of god , do n’t get angry when we want to tell our own stories , and do n’t pitch a fit when we express that we ’re uncomfortable with being objectified for your own sexual gratification . tldlr ; men who love men have never existed for your consumption . we are not your “ escape from heteronormativity ” , we are not your “ safe space for kink exploration ” , we are not your favorite ships , we are not your kudos on ao3 . we are real men with real stories who want a chance to express ourselves in a genre that ’s about us but that we seemingly are n’t allowed into . we are people , and we deserve to and be seen as people and treated like people . stop speaking over us and invalidating our concerns about how we ’re being treated . and that ’s the tea . 🏳 ️‍ 🌈 💁 ‍ ♂ ️ ☕ ️ @ all you straight fujoshis oh my gods this . this is everything i try and fail to say when people ask me how to explain fetishization vs storytelling . do you know how many books by gay men i edited in my time at the erotica publishing house ? one . out of literal thousands of manuscripts , there was one gay man writing m / m , the rest were all by women , and i feel safe in saying , the majority of them , not from within the lgbtqa+ community . and boy howdy did they pitch fits when we turned to them and said “ your manuscript does not meet our health and safety requirements please revise ” because our house had a strict safe sane consensual rule , along with body positivity , which everyone loved when they were writing m / f stories . but when it came to m / m we had so many authors say “ ew , but that ’s not ~sexy~ :/ ” to which my reply was often a very politely phrased “ literally do n’t give a fuck susan , you know what else is n’t sexy ? bleeding assholes , which coincidentally is what you ’re being . ” but y'know , nicer . because i ’m a fucking proffesional . anyway . do you want to know what happened to said singular man writing m / m fiction ? he got dropped after a year . because , and i quote , this is a direct line from our then marketing team , about a gay man writing gay erotica : “ that ’s not what women want to read ” and if that ’s not one of the most precise and fucking infuriating demonstrations of what the fuck is wrong with the “ but i write gay slash fic ! i ca n’t be homophobic ! ” “ ~allies~ ” ( spoiler : you ’re not ) in fandom and yes , even in “ real ” publishing , i dunno what is . there is a difference between storytelling and fetishization , and all y' all crying “ kinkshaming ! ” when someone asks you to treat them with respect , need to stop . believe it or not , gay men do n’t own the concept of m / m . if you want m / m written by men , go over to nifty . fannish spaces like tumblr are predominantly female . we ’ll write whatever the fuck we want , thank you , and we wo n’t grovel to you for your permission . do n’t like it , block it . and it ’s really interesting to me how these anti - slash posts focus so intensely and so hatefully on women masturbating . like it ’s the nastiest thing in the world . oh , noes , women have sexual desires that do n’t take men ’s fee - fees into priority ! boo hoo . check yourself , assholes . could it be also that women do n’t want to read about other women because of empathizing too much with the women in the story ? maybe they want to feel safe and not have to read about women being tortured or hurt etc etc . maybe you do n’t know what it ’s like to be despised in fiction and fantasy . but i do . maybe you need a lesson in shuting the fuck up and listening .</td>\n",

       "      <td>3rdgymbros : magnus is turned into a child , and alex looks after him . posted on fanfiction.net and ao3 the trumpet of an angry elephant , audible even over the clatter of forks and knives scraping food off plates and a roomful of chattering einherjei , quickly causes a hush to fall over the vast crowd . all eyes fall onto a fuming alex fierro , who storms over to the table occupied by the floor nineteen , her eyes flashing . a quivering , child - sized bundle of pink trails along behind her , clutching onto a handful of alex ’s forrest green button - up shirt . “ all right , who the – ” alex , apparently remembering the child at her side , trails off in time and catches herself . “ who did it ? ” t.j trades a puzzled glance with mallory and half - born . “ did what ? ” “ who was the sorry sack of … of potatoes who messed with magnus ? ” alex asks , making sure to raise her voice so that everyone is able to hear her . “ sack of potatoes , ” halfborn mutters under his breath , letting out a bark of laughter that echoes in the ( mostly ) silent room . “ shut up , ” alex snaps testily in response . “ this is serious ! ” “ could you please explain what you meant by that last sentence ? ” half sarcastic and half serious , mallory props her chin up with her hand . “ who   did    what   to magnus ? ” t.j raises his hand , as though he ’s about to ask a teacher a question . “ and who ’s that lost child tagging along with you ? ” all eyes turn to said child , who whimpers unhappily at being the center of attention and buries a tousled head of blond hair into alex ’s side . it ’s not hard to see the unhappiness and discomfort that seem to take tangible space and form in the space around them . alex glares daggers at everyone staring , but speaks in a hushed whisper to the child at her hip , her tone soothing and light . taking the hint , the einherjei present hastily turn their gazes down onto their plates . “ that , ” alex says grimly , “ is magnus . he woke up like this . ” at the sound of his name , the lovely child raises his head . the boy is a toddler still , around five years of age . a soft , golden halo frames his round and cherubic face , with pale skin , apple - pink cheeks and full , upturned lips . the boy is dressed in a fuzzy pink sweater that slips off his shoulders and drags on the floor . it ’s enough to garner coos and sighs from the female ( and even some male ) einherjei . magnus latches onto her waist with his tiny but manacle - strong arms , inching his way behind her . halfborn ’s mouth drops open , revealing a half - chewed mouthful of bread . “ magnus ? that ’s   our   magnus ? ” grey eyes , the colour of pale dove feathers , peek out at halfborn from his place behind alex , right before magnus shakes his head frantically , and presses his face into alex ’s stomach . alex is quick to calm him down , holding him close as he burrows into her for comfort . “ how many other magnuses do you know in this place ? ” alex retorts in a quiet undertone , still keeping a protective arm around mini - magnus . magnus trembles in her arms . “ awex , ” he whimpers , the first thing he ’s said since they ’ve entered the dining room . her noxious bright green hair and generally dry sense of humour have not endeared her to children and adults alike ( not to mention her being transgender and gender fluid , which some particularly religious families have taken to mean that she ’ll be going to hell for her ‘ unnaturalness’ ) , but something warm and protective wells up in her chest at the sight of him clinging to her , trusting that she ’ll keep him safe from all the unfamiliar and possibly scary faces leering at him . and that ’s when alex knows that she ’ll fight and fight to keep this child –    magnus   – safe . “ well , there ’s a magnus down in brooklyn who throws the    best   parties – ” “ does it look like i care about magnus - in - brooklyn ? ” alex wants to scream . “ my –    our   – magnus is a child ! what are we going to    do ? ” an evil grin snakes it ’s way across mallory ’s face . “ my   magnus ? ” “ he ’s rather timid , ” t.j notes , interrupting alex’s - almost - meltdown . “ how come he ’s so attached to you ? ” despite the worry pooling in her belly , a rare grin lights up alex ’s face , and t.j thinks that it ’s easy to see why magnus ( the    older   magnus ) fell in love with her . “ magnus said my hair looked cool . and after i shape shifted a few times , he just … started following me around . ” “ like a duckling imprinting on the first thing it sees , ” mallory mutters under her breath , to which alex , with her eerily sharp hearing , says , “ shut up , keen . ” “ awex ? ” an unfamiliar voice , soft , and quaking with nerves , pipes up . “ awex angwy ?    who make awex angwy ? ” magnus looks around the room defiantly , squaring up his shoulders as though getting ready to fight with whatever – or whomever – is the cause of alex ’s distress . a gasp reverberates around the room . there ’s something strangely endearing about the blond child with a lisp , even as he butchers alex ’s name twice in four seconds . and alex – she does n’t seem remotely angry as she bends to meet magnus’ eyes . it ’s a miracle , t.j thinks , watching alex interact with mini - magnus . “ no , maggie , everything ’s okay . i ’m not angry , see ? ” she flashes him a quick smile , which magnus is quick to reciprocate with a shy upturn of his lips . “ angry people do n’t smile , right ? are    you    okay ? do you want something to eat ? ” “ ’m okay , ” magnus shakes his head when alex offers to get him food . still keeping his arms wrapped firmly around alex ’s denim - clad leg , magnus resumes hiding behind her , resting a soft , pale face against the small of her back . involuntarily , alex feels the blood rush to her cheeks . she hopes her face is n’t as red as it feels . magnus has always been cute , but as a child , the cute factor has been taken up several notches , and now comes in the form of the child at her back . “ you should go see blitzen and hearthstone , ” halfborn advises , once he stops guffawing at alex ’s pink cheeks . it earns him a surprised look of approval from mallory . “ this has ‘ magic’ written all over it . ” “ right , ” alex says , her voice saturated with relief . “ maybe hearthstone can reverse this spell . ” with difficulty , alex turns to address the child - sized bundle of pink behind her . “ c’mon magnus . let ’s go for a walk . did n’t you say you wanted chocolate ice cream ? ” she holds out her hand . nodding enthusiastically , magnus finally relinquishes his hold on her leg , clutching tightly at her long and slender fingers . it ’s like holding ice in her hand , alex thinks , a pang in her chest when she realises that magnus is so obviously scared by the strangers and the unfamiliar environment . but then magnus starts up a chant of , “ ice - cweam , ” and alex nearly wilts in relief , even more so when he graces her with a sunny smile . maybe this whole ‘ turning - turning - into - a - kid’ thing would n’t be so bad after all . magnus , alex learns , still has a love for falafel , even when he ’s regressed to the age of five years old . dressed in a blue button down shirt with jeans ( made and donated by    blitzen ’s best   ) and a pair of converse , magnus chomps happily on the plate of falafel in front of him , occasionally glancing up to beam at alex , who sits on the couch with hearthstone , a cup of hot tea balanced on her lap , sending warm spirals of smoke up into the air . blitzen tries to admonish magnus for getting food down the front of his new clothes , but his voice is closer to a coo than the normal gruff tone that would have come from a scolding . not even the dwarf is immune to magnus’ charms , it seems .      what do you mean you ca n’t turn him back to normal ?   alex signs out clumsily . she tries not to look too upset for magnus’ sake , all too aware of the piercing grey eyes on her back .    you have runes , you know magic , so why . . .      ca n’t . powerful magic .   hearthstone signs slowly , mostly for alex ’s benefit . magnus has been teaching her asl , but sometimes , his rapid - fire signing is hard to keep up with .    work of a god . should wear off in a few days . “ loki ? ”   alex demands , the name leaving a sour aftertaste in her mouth , as though she ’s swallowed a mouthful of curdled milk . hearthstone shakes his head .    no . looks like sjöfn ’s doing . “ sjöfn ? ” alex repeats the name slowly . “ i ’ve never heard of her . ” “ she ’s a minor love goddess , ” blitzen explains , wiping magnus’ face clean with a soft wash cloth . “ usually she ’ll stay out of mortal affairs , but every once in a while , there ’ll be a couple that she absolutely    has   to meddle with . ” he aims a sideways glance at alex . “ lucky all she did was turn magnus into a child . look at how romeo and juliet ended up . not to mention angelina jolie and brad pitt ! ” bet angelina and brad never turned into children . “ so all we have to do is wait ? ” alex asks . hearthstone nods .    spell is n’t permanent . magnus will be fine . besides , blitzen likes small magnus .    hearthstone points at blitzen , who is currently showing a wide - eyed magnus how he makes his best - selling chain mail high waisted skirt . alex bites back her smile .      “ there ’s an orphanage in the city with plenty of children for you two to adopt , ” alex remarks , forgetting to sign and bursts out laughing when hearthstone ’s cheeks flush – the elf might have been deaf , but he certainly was n’t inept at lip - reading . a few days have passed since their meeting with blitz and hearthstone , and magnus still has n’t turned back to normal . alex wonders if she should hunt sjöfn down , but she decides to give it a few more days . she ’d be doing the world a disservice by ridding the world of a mini - magnus , with his soft , pale skin , his tangle of bright blond hair , and his own sweet smell , like apples in a bowl . in a surprisingly short amount of time , magnus has managed to worm his way into the hearts of all the einherjei at hotel valhalla . sam supplied him daily with amir ’s falafel and flying sessions , halfborn gunderson had knitted magnus an assortment of stuffed toys and child - sized   blankets , mallory keen was teaching him gaelic , and t.j played war games with him . even jack had taken magnus for a karaoke session with his friends from hotel valhalla ’s weapons vault . “ you ’re staring , ” sam notes . a young girl , around the age of twelve , had strolled past with a herd of her friends , only to see magnus , and immediately stopped to pick him up for a kiss and a cuddle . the girl giggles with her friends in a way that sets alex ’s teeth on edge . magnus’ dimples flash as he gifts the cooing girls with a shy smile that they are quick to gush over . even though it ’s not directed at her , alex feels the tense set to her shoulders relax . her soul smiles . alex scoffs , her tone sharp and biting . “ am not . ” she keeps a careful eye on magnus , ready to pluck him from the harpy ’s arms if magnus seems the least bit uncomfortable . sam smiles knowingly . “ jealous ? ” “ hardly . ” sam eyes her sister skeptically . “ uh - huh . that would explain why you look like you want to take your garotte and wrap it around emily ’s throat . ” “ is that her name ? ” alex asks innocently , making a mental note to find her in combat later that afternoon . sam ’s only response is to roll her eyes . he ’d originally been content to be passed around from girl to girl , but as soon as he catches sight of alex , standing a little way off with sam , he kicks and struggles , eliciting a shocked squeal from the red - head holding onto him . alex is quick to shoot a nasty glare at the girl , promising death by clay cutter if magnus is n’t let down immediately . his failing arms and legs nearly give the girl a black eye , and she unwillingly sets magnus on his feet . “ awex ! ” magnus squeals , running over as fast as his short , chubby five - year old legs can manage . he holds onto her as though he has suction cups on his arms . “ awex ! ” she ’s grown used to being called ‘ awex’ , but there is nothing like the unadulterated joy of a child calling your name . alex is liberal with her smiles when magnus is involved . she gives him one . sam muffles her laughter with the palm of her hand . alex ignores her , and bends to ruffle magnus’ hair . “ hey , maggie , ” she says , right before the life is squeezed out of her in the form of magnus throwing his arms enthusiastically around her neck . “ having fun ? ” “ yeah ! ” he says , eyes bright and sparkling . “ jack can talk ! an’ we went to awt class ! jack ’s    weaw   good at sewing ! ” “ so i ’ve noticed , ” alex mutters , recalling the bowling bag that jack had worked on with blitzen . jack had regaled them with tales about how he and frey had won numerous awards for their sewing , something that alex would have been very happy not knowing . in a slightly louder voice , she asks , “ so what ’d you make , maggie ? ” “ dis ! ” proudly , magnus holds up a misshapen clay heart , crafted with clumsy , fumbling hands , painted a bright shade of red . “ jack hewped . ” he intones solemnly , pointing at the ‘ alex’ scratched into the surface of the clay before he presses it into alex ’s hands with a shy smile . he looks hopefully at alex , his eyes full of childish innocence and pride . “ awex happy ? ” ( unbeknownst to magnus and alex , sam slips away unnoticed . ) alex resists the urge to tear up , swallowing past the waterworks lump in her throat . her old home may have been filled with all the material goods she could ever want , but if anything , it lacks the charm of her new suite at hotel valhalla . all the gadgets and money in the world , and she ’d trade them all away , without a second thought , for a handmade present from the person she ’s fond of . willing her voice not to crack , alex says slowly , “ i love it . ” and magnus    beams . deep into the wee hours of the night , alex hears the door to her room creak open . she ’s always been a light sleeper , and crunch of footsteps on grass , quiet though they might be , along with snotty sniffles is enough to rouse her from her slumber . alex props herself up on one shoulder , her fingers already inching their way towards the golden wire under her pillow . “ who ’s there ? ” her only response is a teary whimper , one that she could have picked out from a crowd of thousands . quick to flick on her bedside lamp , alex blinks as the sudden light blinds her . “ magnus ? ” she calls , swinging her legs over the side of her bed . “ magnus ? ” her anxiety skyrockets when he does n’t answer ; if anything , the sound of her voice causes magnus to dissolve into more heart - wrenching sobs that feel like a stab in the gut every time . “ where are you ? ” on slightly shaky legs , alex throws back her duvet and slips out of bed , the mattress springs creaking . she makes a beeline for her living room , but a tug at the edge of her shorts stops her . it ’s magnus . his face is flushed . tears clump his normally pale eyelashes together , making them dark . magnus rubs his tears off his cheeks with the sleeve of his pyjamas . alex used to do that too , before she stopped crying altogether . “ magnus ? ” she swipes at his tears with harried , clumsy fingers , giving magnus a quick - once over to ensure he ’s unhurt ( he is ) . she is n’t good at this sort of thing – comforting people , or picking tender words out of midair . but alex tries . “ what ’s wrong ? ” a tear runs down magnus’ cheek . he shakes his head , clamping his lips firmly together . alex takes him by both shoulders and looks him in the face . “ please tell me what ’s wrong . i wo n’t be mad , i promise . ” “ i wanna go home ! ” the words burst out of magnus in a loud torrent , and he dissolves into tears once again . “ i ’ve wooked and wooked , but i can’ find mommy ! ” magnus buries his face in her neck and sobs loudly . alex strokes her hands down magnus’ back , patting and whispering that it ’s okay . she holds magnus and breathes in the smell of his skin , feels the tears falling hot on her skin . inwardly , she ’s spitting out curses in every language she knows . this is what comes of trying to keep things from magnus . this is what happens when , in all the excitement , they forget that magnus is young , and scared , in an unfamiliar place with no familiar faces . this precious child , hurting . “ i ’m so sorry , magnus , ” alex murmurs , as the sobs quiet and magnus begins to draw in long hitching breaths . “ you must have been scared . ” magnus rubs the tear trails from his face with his hand . “ i wike awex , but i wanna see mommy , and annabeth . ” she has no idea who annabeth is , only that magnus is obviously attached to her . an aunt or a cousin maybe ? alex makes a mental note to ask magnus when he turns back into an adult . “ i know , and i ’m sorry , but you ca n’t see them just yet . ” alex tries to evade . “ i ’ll see if i can call them to pick you up , okay ? ” liar , liar , pants on fire . magnus sniffs . his upper lip is caked with snot and his cheeks are streaked with saltwater tracks . “ when ’s mommy coming ? ” how can she tell him that his mother is dead ? ( she does n’t . ) “ soon , ” alex promises , guilt constricting her trachea . “ soon . she ’ll be here in the morning , i promise . ” she scoops him up . “ let ’s get you back to your room . ” “ can i stay ? ” magnus’ voice trembles . his expression punches alex in the gut . he expects rejection . “ pwease ? ” “ ’course , ” alex quickly reassures him , tucking the blankets around both magnus and herself in one smooth motion . alex turns out the light and crawls back into her cocoon of still - warm covers with a sigh . magnus curls up in her arms , pushing , squirming and kicking until he ’s comfortable , touching as much of alex as possible . alex is sure her skin will be dotted with bruises when she wakes up tomorrow . she ’s almost asleep again when magnus says , “ i wuv you awex . ” not something she ’s anticipated hearing . in her startle , alex nearly falls out of bed . she opens and closes her mouth soundlessly , and manages a quiet ,    “ what ? ” “ i wuv you , awex , ” magnus says again , all traces of tears gone . “ and i’w mawwy you when i gwow up . ” a hot flush steals across her cheeks ; she ’s glad for the cover of darkness , where no one can see her blush . “ well , then , ” alex says at last , “ you ’ll have to get me a ring . ” “ ’kay , ” alex can hear the smile in magnus’ voice . his blond head of hair tickles the crook of her arm and his breathing evens out . “ night - night . ” “ ’night , magnus , ” alex murmurs quietly in response , right before her own eyes flutter shut . “ mallory , this is a bad idea , ” t.j whispers behind her . mallory nearly drops her phone . her last picture - a shot of alex pressing her cheek against magnus’ bare chest - is a little blurry , but it ’s nothing a little editing ca n’t fix . she shoots him a glare over a freckled shoulder . “ idiot ! you scared me ! ” “ alex is n’t going to be happy about those pictures . ” “ she 's    never   happy , unless she ’s with magnus . and there ’s no way i ’m passing this chance up . ” “ make it quick . ” t.j shooes her . “ fine ! ” exasperated , mallory shoves her phone into her pocket . “ let ’s get out of here . ” “ should n’t we wake them up ? ” t.j nods at the intertwined couple before he closes the door with a soft snick . “ nope , ” mallory ’s smile is as devious as loki ’s . “ they ’ll find out … eventually . ” t.j and mallory sneak back down the hallway , but they ’ve barely made it five feet when a loud scream resonates from the room they ’ve just left . mallory doubles over with silent laughter , leaning on t.j for support . “ what the – why in the name of the gods are you naked ! ? ” “ please tell me we did n’t have sex –    ow , alex ,    stop   – ” “ get out ! ”</td>\n",

( art is by @marceline2174 ) ffnet : https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10824329/1/distance ao3 : http://archiveofourown.org/works/2615129/chapters/22088900 distance - chapter 49 the normandy hummed gently as she passed through the velvety black of space ; almost completely silent except for the gentle thrumming of the engines . the sounds , so familiar and comforting , kept gina company as she sat alone in her cabin , her stomach turning in knots as she waited for kaidan . and waited . and waited . and waited . his heartbreak over the death of rodriguez had been immediate and apparent , as had his self - recrimination . jack had n’t helped , and the biotic had predictably piled the responsibility for her death at kaidan ’s door , blaming him for slowing her down . “ we should n’t have stayed outside cowering behind rubble ! ” she ’d railed at him furiously , her biotics burning around her in a halo of dancing blue flames , her anger and pain raging out of control . “ this is your fault ! ” jack had almost screamed , jabbing a finger into his chest ; causing gina to hold her breath as she waited for kaidan to react . “ i could have saved her ! i could have saved her ! ” but she could n’t have , and some small part of jack had known it . gina had n’t been there when the temple had come down and cerberus had initially attacked them , but one glance at rodriguez ’s broken body had been enough for her to see that the young woman had been crushed by a falling column when the roof collapsed . there was nothing anyone could have done for her , let alone jack . but kaidan had n’t said that ; he had taken jack ’s wrath , all of it , until it had burnt itself out and she finally collapsed in on herself . “ this is my fault , ” she whispered finally . “ god fucking dammit ! she should n’t have been down there ! none of them should have ; but i took them . i took them on this mission . ” “ we both did , ” kaidan said eventually , and he stepped forward and placed a hand on jack ’s shoulder . “ but it was n’t our fault . we did n’t kill her ; cerberus did . ” read the rest at   ffnet : https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10824329/1/distance or at ao3 : http://archiveofourown.org/works/2615129/chapters/22088900</td>\n",

( i thinks it ’s relevant that ao3 was designed by fandom ’s lj generation and in some respect mirrors the affordances of lj circa 2010 . tumblr is a very different site and that , moreso than age differences , seems to be at the root of this – though of course age intersect with site experience in a non - trivial way . ) ding ding ding ding . ao3 requires you to police your own consumption of content .    ao3 wo n’t let you destroy someone ’s online presence simply because you do n’t like it .    ao3 wo n’t let you impose your own morality on other without cause . if you have issues with this , and the fact that ao3 requires you to have responsibility and agency ,    then you seriously need to sit down and have a damned good long hard look at yourself . the question i usually fail to see being answered when people bitch about the content on ao3 is - so who gets to decide ? you ? me ? a committee of my friends ? of yours ? of those who have the most kudos ? of those who have no interest in fandom , but want to protect other people from dangerous content , whatever it may be ? who gets that power , and how long will they have it ? who are you comfortable with giving the power of regulating all the content ? what happens in grey areas ? what happens when something you like is n’t liked by the decider ? is there an appeal ? who gets to make the arguments for and against something ? the world is complex and there are no easy answers . the impossibility of creating a censorship board that curates based on content is a great reason why those things do n’t exist , and should n’t . certain people are screaming that ao3 is bad because it ’s not a   “ safe space . ” the real problem they have , though , is that ao3 was created to be a safe space - for writers . and it does a pretty good job of that .    it was designed to be a place where writers are safe from arbitrary content rule changes , random and unwarned deletions , and abuse - report abuse ( which is common on ff.net ) . the four big warnings + cntw system is beautiful in its fairness and simplicity . antis ca n’t take control of it . and because control - freakdom is at the heart of their   “ movement , ” this drives them into frenzies . good . it motivated me to dig a little deeper into my pocket to donate on the last drive . for all the pleasure ao3 has given me over the years , that ’s money well spent . the real problem they have , though , is that ao3 was created to be a safe space - for writers .        preach it loud and hard ! i ’m a member of the lj generation , and when i first came to tumblr ( grudgingly and out of desperation , i might add , since it tragically seems to be the only place to really connect with other fandom peeps ) i was horrified at how people here had established this sort of fucked up bully culture , where nobody is responsible for monitoring their own consumption , and rather they expect everyone else to custom tailor content to the whims and desires of the shrieking banshee masses . and woe be to the person who does n’t bend and break ! “ i ’m going to bully you while accusing you and your big mean poopie content of being the actual bully , so i can hopefully distract you and others from realizing i ’m being a royal intrusive asshat who failed astronomy 101 b / c i clearly believe the world revolves around me . ” the irony here is that this in itself is an abuse tactic - victim blaming with a side of gaslighting . pot , meet kettle . and it ’s the exact same mentality that drives right - wing lunatics to kick up a fuss about the existence of icky cootie gay people in media because we need to “ protect family values ” , or who take to screeching at starbucks because their particular religious symbolism is n’t portrayed on the winter holiday cups and omg war on christmas , starbucks stop oppressing me by not catering to my personal taste . the mentality is one and the same - “ cater to me me me or face my divine wrath even if it means taking away other people ’s freedom ! ” while hiding behind a flimsy - ass shield of faux righteous anger .      and when these bozos find an environment or situation where they ’re unable or not allowed to bully people into silence and submission , they stomp their feet and pitch a tantrum and claim that they ’re the ones being oppressed . identical shit , different pile , and it ’s the exact same infantile , schoolyard rubbish no matter which side it ’s coming from . this was a really interesting read . the last poster in particular but all of it . ao3 was literally created to give fan creators a place where they would never be controlled by the whims of those using the so - called protection of the vulnerable as their excuse for bullshit control and attack tactics . when i first saw this post i wanted to scream . because you know what ? a lot of shit on ao3 is in fact evil . its fine and fair to say that people should curate their own content and choices . but i ca n’t imagine i am the only person who was as disastrously unlucky enough to stumble upon any of the most unapologetic pedophilia . or other just as vile untagged fuckery . it was a violent and distressing experience for me , and sure folks like you might think that s my own damn fault . whatever . that s not why i set out to discuss or add here .   because turns out ao3 does have an abuse reporting feature . if its any use , who knows . i do nt . but people should know it exists . i ca n’t speak to ao3′s priorities . perhaps its not there to remove disgraceful content . perhaps they only care about rude reviews and shit comments . whatever . i ’m done with this post and anyone who believes you ’re a crybaby who needs catering to when you want to see abusive content removed . the fuck is the ‘ lj generation’ like y all rly think ur wise elders who need to teach these bad mean children about censorship 🙄 🙄 y all rly acting like lgbt people , people of color and rape survivors are petulant children even when some of these “ antis ” are probably twice yalls age but that does nt fit the narrative that ur the rational logical adults fighting against rabid kids who want to censor ur “ ” “ art ” “ ” but keep thinking ur fighting the good fight by maintaining a safe space for pedophiles , racists , and abusers 😂 i would rather never see a single piece of fannish content ever created again than knowingly provide sanctuary to dangerous evil people and those who would protect them but y all think it would be too hard to have any kind of decency standards so lets just not bother at all . by that argument why have laws ? why have society at all ? after all its complicated to decide what is right and wrong and what rules we should have , so why even try in the first place ! because that totally makes sense 🙃 🙃 🙃 a good portion of the lj generation were pissed off because the new rules included no pornographic depictions of characters under the age of majority , or who were under the age of majority for a large portion of their franchise — that ’s iirc .   it ’s been awhile .      anyway , there was literally   pedophilic content rampant within lj comms and there was no censoring and no attempt by fandom elders to hide content from preteens — which i know , because i never hid or lied about my age to an actual person .      at most , some folks expressed discomfort when i stated my age , and once someone asked me to unfriend / unfollow them because i was younger than their son and they were seriously bothered .   other than that ?   not a peep .         ao3 does n’t care if a pedophile posts work fetishizing a teacher sexually abusing his preschool students even tho that ’s literally child pornography . and illegal as fuck . they ’re hosting some pretty evil shit , and acting like they should n’t be held even slightly accountable is really irresponsible . there is a middle ground between complete censorship and letting users post child porn on their site . i think you ’ve got your terminology mixed up . ( upfront disclaimer : i ’m from the us , so i ’m working with the us legal definition , other countries may differ . additionally , ao3 is us based , so that is the law system that is relevant to the discussion of the site . ) child pornography :   any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor ( someone under 18 years of age ) .   visual depictions include photographs , videos , digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor , and images created , adapted , or modified , but appear to depict an identifiable , actual minor . ( x ) so , if the example you mentioned is written , it categorically does not count . if the example you mentioned is fictional art , it categorically does not count . if either of the above two are true , it is therefore not   ‘ illegal as fuck’ although it may appear on a morality scale anywhere from gross or not - in - good - taste to disgusting trash or not - enough - brain - bleach - in - the - world . but that is personal opinion and not actually a legal matter . on the other hand , if ao3 is honestly hosting actual child porn somewhere on the site , then report it , because that is not allowed ( x ) . neither , for that matter is abuse of the rating system ( tagging something as g or t when it should be m or e ) or archive warnings ( not tagging   ‘ choose not to warn’ or any of the other archive warnings when they do in fact apply ) ( x ) . as to responsibility , they are doing nothing illegal . they are being as responsible ,   as any other free similar - content site on the web , if not more so . also :      we are also lgbtq / queer , rape / sexual assault survivors , abuse survivors , mentally ill , disabled , etc . you do not get to fucking claim those categories as if you speak for us . you do not get to set the standard for those identities .      as someone who was on fucking lj at the time , you know who was the most terrified , the most violated , by strikethrough ? survivors .    survivor ’s comms .   survivors who rped . survivors who had support groups .      queer writers . like me . because warriors for innocence - the right - wing dominionist xtian group behind it - used   “ child pornography ” as their smoke - screen but fucking trust me , we knew they were coming for us .      teenage writers like i had been ( i started on lj at 16 and was in my very early 20s for strikethru ) , who were fucking tired of pretending that because we were 17 instead of 18 ( or 19 or whatever magical number - divorced , often , even from actual legal age of majority - it was that someone felt we needed to have passed ) we needed to be ~*protected from all discussion of sex evar*~ and in fact cherished , valued and were well - served by adults who had a damn clue . who gave us space to engage with fiction   for one of the best opportunities that fiction offers : that of messing around and working through all kinds of experiences and emotions without having to live or re - experience them in the flesh .      you do not get to frame this as a righteous battle between poor vulnerable survivors , queers / lgbtq , teenagers , etc , and mean privileged people , because we are also fucking part of those categories .   we are survivors , we are queer , we are mentally ill . the people you are attacking include poc , they include trans people , they include survivors of childhood abuse , they include survivors of incest . stop trying to act like they do n’t .      and , as i know i have talked about previously , you also do n’t get to demand that everyone who works with darker fiction for this shit clearly disclose to you their status . you have no right , no right , to demand that people bare their souls to you in order to determine whether their fiction   is allowed to exist .      these are not your hot - button to hit to make everyone else shut up . you do not get to say   “ i ’m x - group so what i say goes . ” we are too .        “ but y all think it would be too hard to have any kind of decency standards so lets just not bother at all . by that argument why have laws ? why have society at all ? “ yeah no . a tagging system like the one ao3 has   is literally a set of standards .      besides which , ao3 is not a government . ao3 does not set the rules for what fanfic gets to exist . it ’s a fucking website . if you do n’t like their standards , do n’t use their website . make your own website where whatever thing you dislike is forbidden . meanwhile , as everyone else has said , quit pretending you ’re in a moral crusade against evil people who write bad things .      because honestly , among any number of other good reasons , insinuations that i ’m evil because i write bad things ? is fucking triggering . i ’m sort of amazed that there ’s a contingent of people that are actually calling for censorship on a free fanfic site . slippery slope .        i followed this post for some time now and what i really do n’t get , where are all this untagged evil fics on ao3 ? i ’ve been on that archive since its start and also an lj veteran . i am active in multiple fandoms and certainly not shying away from m - rated fics . but in over 15 years of reading fanfiction online ( not even in lj - times ) have i come across what they are describing . imho you must have to really dig for examples because otherwise - statistically speaking - i should come across those fics regularly . and it never happens … so , i smell troll in the dungeon “ ur the rational logical adults fighting against rabid kids who want to censor ur “ ” “ art ” “ ” yep .   ",
       " \" ur fighting the good fight by maintaining a safe space for pedophiles , racists , and abusers 😂 ” yep ! because if the free expression of the guy you hate is n’t protected * , then neither is yours . that ’s how it works . and you know who does n’t like ( or if i ’m being charitable , who does n’t understand ) that ? fascists , nazis , totalitarians , and “ rabid kids who want to censor ur ” “ \" art ” “ ” . way to pick your bedfellows . * ao3 , as a non - governmental operation obviously has no legal obligation to protect or enable any kind of expression at all : it is merely to their obvious and great credit that they do .</td>\n",

” he asked , reaching for the plates to help clean up . “ usually . lunch is the only somewhat calm meal . ” yuuri stretched with a deep sigh . “ i need a nap before then . ” “ kits keep you up ? ” “ no , viktor , ” he replied dryly , pausing before he continued and flushing a bit as he obviously changed his mind . “ so what do you have planned for the day ? ” guang - hong shrugged . “ unpack maybe . is there anything you need help with ? ” “ mmm , there ’s still enough leftovers from the feast to take care of lunch for today . the kits are tending the gardens and picking vegetables for dinner later . ” yuuri set the last of the dishes in the basin and filled it with water . “ i can ask around and see if anyone needs a hand if you ’d like . ” “ sure . thanks . ” at least he was making progress . his chat with chris had left him feeling lighter and ready to face the challenge of making this his home . “ have a nice nap . ” he grabbed a glass of tea to take back with him , glancing at his trunks and taking a deep breath . he could do this . it would n’t take that long if he did n’t get distracted . he started with his clothes , sorting and folding them to put in the dresser . the empty trunks went into the closet . he found his knife tucked away in the third trunk and slipped it under his pillow , glancing to the window to make sure no one was watching . he finished emptying one trunk of books and was half done with the second when there was a knock on his door . he stuck his head out the window to see chris with a small tray . “ i get the feeling you ’re all trying to fatten me up for slaughter . ” chris laughed , moving to the window to hand over the tray . “ slaughter would be the last thing on my mind , ” he said with a wink . guang - hong blinked , his mind trying to wrap itself around the notion of chris flirting with him . “ what are you doing all holed up in here ? ” “ uh … unpacking , ” he said , ignoring the flush of heat in his cheeks as he eyed the bowl of peaches with a large glob of cream . he dipped his finger in it before licking it clean . that was delicious - fresh and slightly sweet . he scooped up more , glancing up with a smile only to find chris staring at him as he sucked his finger clean . he felt his face go scarlet , pulling his finger out of his mouth and turning for the door so he could compose himself . just breathe . it was n’t like he had n’t been hit on before , he just was never in a position to return the sentiment even if he ’d wanted to . once he ’d been … involved in his father ’s work , what interest he ’d had in getting attached to anyone who could get hurt because of him vanished entirely . he banged his forehead against the wall a couple times before pulling the door open . “ really though . what ’s with all the food ? ” chris raised an eyebrow as he stepped inside . “ if you stopped missing meals , yuuri would n’t worry so much . ” guang - hong wrinkled his nose and dipped a slice of peach in the cream before popping it in his mouth . he had n’t missed that many … just dinners … and breakfast . “ sorry . ” chris waved a hand . “ so long as you ’re adjusting . you need help unpacking ? ” “ i ’m almost done i think . ” just his books and the trunk with his few pictures and treasures he had n’t been able to leave behind were left . he dropped down on the large chair , crossing his legs as he worked through the rest of the peaches . “ is there anything i can help with ? what is it you do ? ” “ me ? ” chris shrugged . “ a lot of odds and ends , help keep the peace , unofficial record keeper . ” “ that sounds difficult . ” “ not too bad until yurio decides to pick a bone with someone , ” chris said dryly . guang - hong snickered , resisting the urge to swipe up the last of the cream with his finger and setting the bowl on the table instead . “ i might go wander . i have n’t really seen much outside of the tour . yuri said there ’s a shrine ? ” “ to inari , yeah . there ’s a small path that leads to it near the barn . careful you do n’t get lost , or touch anything . yurio’ll get cranky if you do . ” “ speaking from experience ? ” chris grinned . “ maybe . he used to need weekly reminders that his attitude sucked . he ’s calmed a lot these past couple years . ” guang - hong was n’t sure he wanted to know what yuri used to be like if he was “ calm ” now . chris reached for the bowl , using his own finger to dip up what was left of the cream and licking it off with a wink . “ go wander . fresh air should do you good , ” he said , standing and heading to the door with a decidedly teasing flick of his tail . “ yell if you need anything . ” “ thanks … . ” he breathed a soft sigh once the door closed behind chris , rubbing at his face . what the hell was that ? air . he definitely needed fresh air . he pulled his boots on and headed out , thankful for the breeze as he stuck to the shade as much as possible . the barn was easy enough to find and he took a few minutes watching the animals . there were way more than he ’d originally seen - chickens , sheep , goats … he even spied some rabbits , but they seemed to be wild . a large grey wolf - dog dozed near the sheep , the flicking ears betraying its alertness . he pushed away from the fence , walking around the barn until he found the path to the shrine . only a dozen steps brought him into the thick of the forest , the path winding between trees , parts of it obscured by bushes and flowers he ’d never seen before . when he came to a fork , he stopped , cursing under his breath . chris had n’t mentioned having to choose a direction . did that mean he was lost ? fantastic . he closed his eyes and refrained from turning around in case he lost what direction he ’d come from . he steadied his breathing until his heartbeat was n’t pounding in his ears , focusing on the music of the forest instead - the wind - rustle of the leaves , the droning cicadas , the staggered trills of songbirds . beneath it he could just make out the sound of water , but he could n’t focus on it with the sound of … singing overshadowing it . he turned towards the singing , following it around a bend and stopping as he found leo in front of an injured deer , a couple of spotted fawns next to him . one of them had its hooves on his back as it chewed at his hair . guang - hong stifled a laugh of surprise behind his hand , unable to believe the sight . he ducked behind a large bush , unwilling to make his presence known , both in case it startled the animals and because he was sure leo ’s mood would turn sour . leo tended to the doe ’s injured leg as he continued singing , though he did n’t understand the words . the lilt sounded like an upbeat song despite the somber tone of his voice . he had a good singing voice , and he actually looked … kind of cute when he was n’t scowling , and why the hell was he thinking that ? chris had to be getting to him . it was n’t like seeing leo being kind changed the fact he was a jerk . he bit his lip as he realized he was spying , taking a step back and wincing as a twig snapped beneath his foot . he froze as the deer startled . crap . if leo wanted to kill him , now would be the most opportune time . he tensed as leo looked up , putting himself in front of the injured animal and drawing a long knife from the sheath on his thigh . the sight of the weapon triggered his trained instincts enough he was reaching for his own weapon that was n’t there before he could stop himself , his trainer ’s words echoing through his head : leave no witnesses . leo was n’t a witness . this was n’t a job and he was n’t in any danger . he hoped . he swallowed as leo looked at the bush he was hiding behind for several heartbeats before finally turning back , sheathing his weapon . “ that ’s all i can do . stay away from the thicket from now on , yeah ? ” leo snorted as the deer butted her head against him before turning , her fawns trotting after her . guang - hong held his breath as leo picked up the supplies , wondering if he should run for it or just stay still and hope for the best . “ i really hope you do n’t think you ’re hidden . ” shit . he winced as leo stood and walked right towards him . “ i was n’t spying … . ” he said , stepping out from behind the bush . “ right . ” guang - hong made a face before taking a breath , refusing to let leo get to him . “ i was looking for the shrine and … followed your voice when i heard you singing . it was good . ” leo eyed him in surprise , looking away with a faint flush and hefting his bag . “ … the shrine is this way . ” he turned and started back towards the other fork in the path . apparently his mother was right , a little kindness went a long way . he smirked and followed after . “ you ’re good with animals . ” “ i guess . ” guang - hong hummed and took the chance to look for any landmarks or defining markers , though all he could make out was green , green , and more green , sometimes interrupted by large , bright flowers . “ how do you not get lost out here ? ” leo glanced back at him with a twitch of his ears . “ how do you not get lost in your cities ? ” guang - hong tilted his head , biting his tongue against the urge to say they had roads and signs . it was n’t like he looked at the signs half the time anyway . “ the buildings all look different . they act as landmarks . ” “ so do the trees . ” leo slowed a minute later near a tree larger than the others in the area , it ’s branches extending up and out further than he could see . the sound of water grew louder the closer they got . “ shrine is he- ” he started , stopping and looking around as his ears twitched . he took off around the tree with a curse . guang - hong hurried after , the shrine coming into view on the other side , tucked into a hole carved into the massive trunk . the source of the water came from a spring that welled up under the carving of a fox with nine tails and turned into a deep pool beneath the tree ’s roots . yuri was hunched over near where the path ended , one arm pressed against his stomach . he looked up when leo dropped down next to him , slapping his hand away . “ i ’m fine . just something i ate . ” he stood up with a grimace . “ why are you two here ? ” “ i just wanted to explore the village … are you sure you ’re okay ? ” yuri brushed back the strands of hair that had fallen free from his weave . “ i ’m fine . ” “ you ’re pale , ” leo said . yuri glared . “ i ’m fine , ” he said , turning towards the shrine . he swayed to the side as he walked . he and leo both rushed forward , grabbing yuri ’s arms as he lost his balance . “ you ’re not fine . you should rest . ” yuri growled and tried to get away from their hold before nearly collapsing again with a soft moan . “ maybe . ” guang - hong glanced at leo over yuri ’s head . “ should we carry him ? ” leo slanted an annoyed look at him , though he could see the concern beneath it . he handed his pack over before scooping yuri up in his arms . “ keep up . ” guang - hong caught the pack and broke into a run just to keep up with leo ’s quick strides . the overhanging leaves and branches seemed to pull away from their path despite them cutting through the thick of the forest . when the forest finally gave way to the village , he slowed to catch his breath . several of the others were gathered near the dining area and leo continued on ahead , the others crowding around him and yuri as he reached them . he drew up to them a couple minutes later , setting leo ’s bag on the end of the table . seung - gil crouched in front of yuri , speaking with him in quiet tones . “ guang - hong , good to see you again . ” guang - hong tensed and turned to see phichit walking towards them , wearing a gold and red yukata that strangely suited him . “ phichit … . ” phichit smiled , patting him on the shoulder as he passed , pausing as he looked at yuri and seung - gil . “ yuri . congratulations . ” yuri looked up in annoyance . “ screw you , too . ” seung - gil looked at phichit a moment before turning back to yuri . “ he ’s saying you ’re pregnant . ” “ i ’m what ? ! ” “ he ’s what ? ” guang - hong winced at the loud chorus of disbelief . yuri was … pregnant ? he supposed he ’d known subconsciously it was possible considering yuuri and viktor had children who looked exactly like them , but the concept of a male giving birth was a bit to really wrap his mind around . “ yurio , when did you get yourself a mate ? ” viktor asked , patting yuri on the back . “ i did n’t , ” yuri snapped , shifting to slap at viktor ’s hand . “ of course you did ! ” “ it ’s otabek , right ? ” “ knew you smelled different . ” “ we should bring him here to be with you , ” yuuri added . “ no ! ” yuri snarled loud enough to silence everyone , pushing to his feet only to wince and sink back down . “ leave him alone . ” “ yuri … you know how difficult- ” seung - gil started . “ i mean it ! ” yuri bared his teeth and flattened his ears like an angry cat . guang - hong stepped closer to yuri and sank down beside him , acting on impulse as he wrapped his arms around him . it might have been close to suicide , but at least he had the advantage of being an outsider ; yuri might not immediately claw his eyes out . “ what the- ” yuri snarled , twitching back without fully dislodging his hold . “ it ’s okay . just breathe . ” guang - hong let out a soft sigh of relief when yuri at least stopped growling . it was n’t much , but it was a start . he tilted his head as viktor moved closer , dropping down to kneel in front of yuri and resting a hand on his knee . “ it ’s okay to be scared . ” yuri bared his teeth with a snarl . “ i ’m not- ” “ do you want the baby ? ” guang - hong asked softly , tensing as he felt several pairs of eyes settle on him . yuri glanced away , pressing his hand against his stomach as his ears twitched . “ i ’d make a terrible parent . ” yuuri scoffed and stepped closer . “ if that were true , i ’d never leave the kits with you unsupervised . ” guang - hong pulled back as yuuri settled on yuri ’s other side , tilting his head as he studied the blond . yuri was n’t that upset about finding out he was … pregnant ( he did n’t even want to try to fathom how that was possible right now ) , he was more upset about otabek . he glanced down at viktor . “ is being a sacrifice the only way outsiders are allowed in ? ” viktor glanced up in surprise before smiling . “ of course not ! ” he looked back at phichit . “ diplomatic visit ? ” phichit raised an eyebrow , drumming his fingers against his arm before grinning . “ diplomatic consort . ” yuri twitched as he straightened . “ haaa ? ” “ perfect ! ” viktor snapped his fingers and stood . “ what do you say ? let us bring otabek here . he wo n’t be a sacrifice . ” yuri hissed and rubbed at his stomach before slumping . “ fine . ” “ i ’ll get him , it ’ll be the quickest , ” said phichit . seung - gil turned a disapproving glare on him . “ you ’re exhausted . ” phichit scoffed . “ what kind of mage would i be if i ca n’t even do a simple teleport ? ” “ simple ? ” phichit grinned , his expression softening a bit as seung - gil continued glaring . “ one way teleport , ” he said , resting his hand on seung - gil ’s shoulder . “ promise i ’ll be careful . ” “ wait . ” yuri reached up and pulled something like a stick out of his hair , the end carved into a sleeping cat . “ so he knows i sent you … ” he muttered , handing it over . phichit took it with a look of amusement . “ thanks . ” he moved his fingers through the air and guang - hong could almost see the magic twirling and folding around him in response . he leaned closer to seung - gil and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek a moment before he vanished . “ idiot . ” seung - gil turned to leave , pausing with a glance to yuri . “ make sure you drink something . and eat whatever you think you can keep down . ” yuuri stood . “ i ’ll make some tea . can you eat some toast ? ” “ maybe . ” yuri sighed and slumped back against the table , fingers twitching where he pressed them against his stomach . guang - hong glanced at the others and somehow was n’t surprised to find leo had slipped away at some point . “ how long does it take to travel here ? ” yuri eyed him , shifting to prop an arm on the table with a soft snort . “ if he takes baron , a couple hours maybe . ” “ is baron his horse ? ” yuri ’s smirk widened . “ more like his bear . ” guang - hong stared . right . if yuri had a giant cat , of course his “ diplomatic consort ” would have a giant bear he could ride . what else would he ride ? this was n’t just some twisted dream , was it ? gods , kitsune , magic , giant cats and bears … what was next , being told he should mate with one of them ? he tensed and sat up with a flinch , glancing at yuuri . he ’d been a sacrifice , and now he was with viktor . with kits . why had n’t he realized sooner ? any sacrifice who came in either stayed or … returned home within a few weeks . the rare exceptions were the royal sacrifices , and now that he thought about it , there always seemed to be rumors of them disappearing for days or a week at a time . “ who was i brought here for ? ” viktor lifted his head from where he ’d been resting it on yuuri ’s shoulder . “ what ? ” his eyes flicked toward yuri before settling on guang - hong . he curled his fingers into fists and took a steadying breath . “ sacrifice . to be given up . who am i supposed to be sacrificed to ? ” “ that ’s not- ” “ who ? ! ” viktor pulled away from yuuri with a sigh , running his fingers through his hair . “ phichit thought you might get along well with leo , but- ” “ leo ? ” they thought he ’d get along with leo ? “ i know you two got off on the wrong foot , but he ’s really- ” guang - hong stood abruptly enough viktor stopped talking , anger and something like panic swelling up inside him . “ if i do n’t … if i do n’t … . ” he flicked his fingers . “ i ca n’t stay ? ” viktor let out a long breath through his nose . “ not usually , no . ” he sucked in a breath at the feeling of being punched in the gut . he nodded and turned to head back towards the house . how was that fair ? he needed a minute to … let the implications of it all sink in . so that was it . he was basically … here to be married off ? he shut the door behind him when he reached it and sank down onto the couch . was this how his sister felt when their father arranged her marriage with someone she hardly knew ? like everything was about to come crashing down around her ? how many times could his life change directions in just a few days ? he was overreacting , was n’t he ? would it really be so bad , being someone ’s husband ? he may not have dwelt on it too much , but he ’d always imagined he ’d be able to find someone he could comfortably spend the rest of his life with . eventually . after he somehow escaped his family ’s business . that certainly would n’t be possible with leo . not when leo despised him for no reason . why him anyway ? leo obviously did n’t want anything to do with … him … which meant leo knew why he was here ? and did n’t … want him … oh . that certainly put things in perspective . no wonder he ’d said to leave . somehow it hurt , knowing he ’d been brought here specifically for someone who could n’t even stand to look at him . what did that mean ? that no matter what he did , he ’d eventually be sent back home ? that he ’d been given a chance at a different life and might be sent back into his life of sleepless nights and blood - soaked clothing , because a … a blind - date went horribly wrong ? he dragged himself to the bedroom , glancing to the window and jumping as he saw yuuri standing there . “ sorry . did n’t mean to startle you . ” yuuri smiled , propping his chin on his crossed arms . “ you okay ? ” guang - hong sighed and dropped onto the bed . “ ‘ m fine … . ” he glanced up at yuuri , twisting the sheet in his fingers . “ is that really the only way to stay here ? ” “ i do n’t know , i ’ve only been here a few years . other than jj , any of the other sacrifices have gone to the other villages . ” yuuri pushed his glasses up . “ i think in the end , they can vote to let you stay . ” but how likely would that be ? he was already off to a bad start . “ why do they need us anyway ? ” yuuri hummed and drummed his fingers against the sill . “ they ’re a dying race . or they were , for a while . they ’re stabilising now , but … females are rare ; klara is the first female born to her generation . inari granted them a gift that allows the males to bear children , but there ’s still too few of them to be able to mate with each other . ” he shrugged with a sheepish smile . “ at least that ’s what i ’ve put together since coming here . ” “ and you were brought here for viktor ? ” “ ah … not really . i was n’t selected with anyone specific in mind as far as i know . the ritual they used to have was a festive gathering to see who took a liking to who , and i was nervous and … drank half the wine . i woke up in viktor ’s bed without remembering anything . ” he laughed and rubbed his nose . “ i punched chris trying to run away . i think they stopped having the ritual after that . sorry . ” guang - hong groaned and flopped back on the bed . yuuri sighed . “ i know you feel lost and completely out of your element , but you have time to get to know everyone . we can invite some others from the other villages if you want . i doubt they ’d force you to leave . you ’re not expected to just hook up with someone within a week . ” “ what happened to jj ? ” “ jj was … a mutual parting of ways … ” guang - hong lifted his head enough to eye yuuri . “ he did n’t exactly get along with anyone . he was the one who asked to leave . ” “ i have a feeling yuri threatened to castrate him if he did n’t , ” he muttered , smiling faintly as yuuri laughed . still , that made him feel a little better . he sighed and dropped his head back to the bed . “ okay , ” he murmured . “ i ’ll stop sulking . ” “ is this sulking or panicking ? ” he winced and groaned again . “ both ? ” he crawled off the bed with a sigh . he could n’t really be upset at finding out , he ’d wanted to know his purpose here after all . apparently he had n’t learned the lesson that curiosity killed the cat . maybe if he had n’t gone snooping through his father ’s bookkeeping all those years ago , he would n’t have been pushed so far into taking an active part in the business . “ come on , help me keep yurio from going on a rampage . he ’s nervous , but he wo n’t admit to it . ” guang - hong smiled faintly . “ over the baby or his consort ? ” yuuri laughed . “ both , but because of otabek more , i think . he ’s done his best to keep him secret . ” he raised an eyebrow at that as he headed out of the bedroom to join yuuri outside . “ why ? ” “ he does n’t like showing weakness . ” “ ah . ” there was a sentiment he could understand , though he was doing an atrociously poor job of not showing his own weaknesses . “ sorry i ’ve been a mess , ” he murmured , smiling faintly as yuuri slung an arm around his shoulders . “ … are there any other surprises i should know about though ? i ’d rather get all the shock out of my system now . ” yuuri chuckled . “ i do n’t think so . and trust me , you ’re not going to be expected to … you know , before you ’re ready . enjoy yourself , get to know everyone , and do n’t worry about trying to force something . ” guang - hong took a deep breath and nodded . “ that ’s basically what chris said . ” “ oh ? when did you talk to chris about it ? ” he flushed a bit and ducked his head . “ last night . ” he bit his tongue against the urge to mention the … silence spell . he was n’t sure why he felt he could trust and open up to yuuri , but he was sure it had something with his ‘ mother hen’ aura . “ he seems nice . ” “ everyone is pretty nice . even leo , when he ’s not being obstinate . ” yuuri squeezed his shoulders . “ are you still wanting to help out ? if you do n’t mind some manual labor , with emil on patrol we do n’t have anyone to fix any tools that break or dull . you any good at that ? ” “ maybe . ” he ’d cared for his own knives and swords , he ’d be able to at least sharpen things . “ yurio can show you around . it ’ll keep him occupied until the famous otabek arrives . ” guang - hong glanced at him with a faint smile . “ are you pawning the kits off on us , too ? ” “ i ’m not that cruel . ” he snorted quietly , straightening when yuuri pulled his arm away and moved to join viktor where he was sitting across from yuri . “ yurio , why do n’t you show guang - hong the shed ? ” yuri looked up from picking at his toast . “ why ? it ’s right over there . ” he raised an eyebrow and stared back at yuuri until he sighed . “ you ’re so stubborn . ” yuuri leaned into viktor with a roll of his eyes . guang - hong snorted softly as the three of them bickered , filling a glass with some of the flavored tea and settling next to yuri . viktor pulled out a deck of cards and they taught him how to play spielen . yuri turned out to be quite the devious tactician and he knew the other two well enough to know when to call them out . to be fair , it was n’t all that hard to break their codes once he learned they used the game as an excuse to call each other sickeningly sweet pet names . they had lunch and had gone through several more rounds , each more frenetic than the last , when they heard a commotion and what sounded like a very large animal thundering closer . he looked up in time to see a giant bear skid to a stop nearby and a tall , dark - haired human dropped from its back holding a long spear . “ yura ! ” yuri straightened , his golden ears twitching wildly as he turned towards otabek . “ beka . ” otabek dropped the spear as he fell into a crouch in front of yuri before he could stand , reaching for his hands and pressing the hair ornament into them . “ it ’s true ? ” he asked quietly . “ why did n’t you tell me ? ” “ i just found out , idiot , ” yuri snapped . guang - hong watched them from the corner of his eye as he helped gather up the cards . he did n’t miss the way yuri relaxed and clutched at otabek ’s hands , or the fact he was smiling despite the tone . it was faint , but it was there . “ you did n’t have to come . ” otabek narrowed his eyes . “ yura , if you think there is any way i am leaving knowing you ’re carrying my child- ” he started , his words cutting off as yuri pressed two fingers to his lips . he huffed against them before pulling back to look at the rest of them , his gaze landing on viktor and yuuri . “ you must be the ones he calls the idiot duo . ” “ beka ! ” “ oh , is that what he calls us ? ” viktor propped his chin up on his fist . “ yuuri , did you know he had such a vulgar name for us ? ” yuuri handed the rest of the cards to guang - hong . “ i figured he called us something . honestly , i thought it ’d be worse . ” yuri groaned and slumped forward to press his face into otabek ’s shoulder . “ i hate you . ” “ that ’s going to make raising a child together difficult . ” guang - hong could n’t help grinning as he saw yuri ’s ears going red . viktor chuckled . “ maybe you should take otabek home . you two have a lot to discuss . ” yuri grumbled before yelping as otabek scooped him up . “ dammit , beka , put me down ! ” “ where ’s your home ? i want to see it . ” otabek nodded to them before turning and carrying a loudly protesting yuri towards his home . “ do n’t miss dinner ! ” yuuri called after them , snorting when yuri gave them the middle finger in response . “ that went well . ” viktor grinned . “ our family is growing . ” he kissed yuuri ’s temple and stood , looking to guang - hong . “ come on , i ’ll show you to the tools if you still want to try your hand at them . ” halfway there , he heard a loud growl and turned just in time to see sasha leap through the air and pounce on otabek ’s bear . he shook her off and they circled each other with bared teeth until they butted heads and … rubbed against each other . well then . apparently they got along as well as their owners . he glanced to viktor when he chuckled and they continued to the shed . it was simple enough , and all the tools and supplies were kept neat and organized . “ thank you . for helping yurio earlier . ” guang - hong glanced up at viktor with a smile . “ it was fun . i have n’t played cards in ages . ” viktor shook his head . “ no , i mean when you helped calm him down … he has a tendency to overreact to things . ” he shrugged , glancing away and fiddling with a small tub of spare parts . “ he was panicking . ” he ’d done that enough himself to know it helped if someone was there to make you breathe . he looked up in surprise as viktor rested a hand on his shoulder . “ i ’m sorry i made you upset . you ’re welcome to stay here as long as you like . ” guang - hong smiled in relief . “ thank you . ” viktor patted his shoulder . “ holler if you need anything . ” he watched viktor go and let out a sigh as he looked back to the tools . there was a pedal - powered grinding stone in the corner and he wrinkled his nose , poking through the supplies until he found some whetstones . there were a couple daggers dull enough they would n’t even cut his skin and he settled in to work on sharpening them . caring for his weapons had always been a task he could put his whole into , despite knowing what he ’d have to use them for . his weapons were just objects until given a purpose , and objects were useless if they were n’t cared for . he soon lost himself in the rhythmic scrape of stone on metal . it was soothing . relaxing . tension eased out of him and he found himself humming tunelessly as he finished the first one . he grabbed a thick strip of leather to swipe the blade on , testing its edge and setting it aside when he found it sharp . he picked up another and was just finishing with it when he noticed someone watching him , looking up to find leo at the entrance . “ hey , ” he said with a smile . it dissipated when leo ignored him , stepping inside and setting an axe and a large knife on the table . so he was back to being a jerk . he sighed and turned his attention back to the dagger . “ you ’re not needed here . ” he tensed , aware leo meant he did n’t need him here , but that did n’t matter , did it ? “ someone thought so . ” he sighed and lifted his head as he felt the warnings of a headache ; he really did n’t want to deal with an argument when he ’d just found something to distract him . “ do n’t you have more important things to do ? ” leo ’s ears twitched and he bared his teeth a moment before leaving with a huff . guang - hong sighed and slumped on the stool once he was alone again , finishing the dagger and picking up the knife . he was n’t sure what he should do about leo . should he avoid him , or try to befriend him ? part of him wanted to know why leo seemed to hate him so much , but it was n’t worth the headache . once he finished sharpening everything , he cleaned up and explored the rest of the shed . other than the grinding stone , the only other large equipment was a small forge built into a back corner . shelves lined the walls , most will jars or spare parts , though one was filled with trinkets with a box of metal and wood pieces beneath . on closer inspection , the trinkets were tiny figurines of various shapes and sizes - over two dozen plants and animals and a larger one that covered his hand and looked like a dragonfly . the delicate metal wings were practically transparent , enough he could see his hand through them , and the eyes were tiny black , faceted gems . he grinned as he moved a wing and they both moved simultaneously . whoever made it was gifted . he set it back on the shelf and headed back to see if yuuri needed help with dinner . the sun was lower than it should have been , which meant he ’d lost more time than he thought . viktor was lounging at the table while yuuri set bowls and plate of food out , tugging him closer every time he brought a new one over to steal a kiss . their kits were nearby , playing chase with the bear and tiger . he paused halfway , not wanting to intrude , but viktor spotted him and waved him over . “ we were about to summon everyone for dinner . ” “ you were about to eat half the potatoes before yurio could get to them , ” yuri said with a snort . viktor gasped . “ i would never deprive an innocent soul of potatoes . ” guang - hong raised an eyebrow as he dropped down at the table . after seeing the two of them fighting over the last piece of bacon , he did n’t believe that . “ you ’re talking about the baby are n’t you ? ” viktor winked . “ maybe . ” “ not maybe . ” yuri set a plate of biscuits on the table before poking the top of viktor ’s head . “ go rouse the troops , you fiend . ” viktor stood and swatted yuri with his tail on his way out . guang - hong snagged a biscuit . “ this looks delicious . you made all of this ? ” “ viktor helped a bit . ” yuuri filled two glasses with tea and set one in front of him as he sat across from him . the others trickled in a few minutes later . yuri and otabek followed after viktor , fingers laced together , and even from the table , he could see the scowl and flush on yuri ’s face . they sat next to each other at the end of the table , yuri next to guang - hong with otabek on the end . viktor setted the kits next to yuuri before sitting on their other side , and chris took a seat on guang - hong ’s other side . leo sat on chris’ other side and he was grateful for the barrier between him and the surly fox . emil arrived with seung - gil and he tilted his head , glancing at yuuri with a slight frown . was n’t he on patrol , or was he getting their names mixed up ? yuuri caught his eye with a faint smile . “ emil brought phichit back . he passed out on the way . i do n’t think he ’ll be waking up before tomorrow . ” he shook his head with a sigh . “ he really should n’t have teleported . ” “ he was that exhausted ? ” emil sat on yuuri ’s other side and seung - gil next to him , his expression rivaling leo ’s for most constipated . “ magical exhaustion is different , and worse , than just being tired . he could have gotten himself killed , ” seung - gil all but growled . “ but he did n’t . no sense worrying about it now , ” chris said , snagging a biscuit before he started scooping food onto his plate . seung - gil clenched his fist on top of the table , grinding his teeth . “ so . otabek . how long are you staying with us ? ” viktor asked , smiling blithely as the tension at the table eased considerably . “ until the child is old enough to start a family of its own . ” yuri spit tea across the table , narrowly missing viktor ’s face . “ are you insane ? ” otabek tilted his head . “ no . ” yuri ’s mouth moved , but no sounds came out , until he finally groaned and buried his face in his arms . guang - hong bit his lip to keep from laughing , digging into his food as yuuri and viktor drilled otabek with questions about his home and why he ’d never visited earlier . apparently , otabek had asked once , only for yuri to deny him , and he had n’t dared to ask again . his kingdom was responsible for much of the ore and fur trade to the other kingdoms , and his family regulated both to prevent eradication of either . he blinked as chris leaned into him as they were finishing their meal . “ what are your plans for the evening ? ” “ i … had n’t thought about it , ” guang - hong replied , a shiver going up his spine . chris was n’t … was he ? “ interested in a swim ? ” “ uh … i do n’t have a swimsuit , ” he replied , sounding lame even to his own ears . chris smirked and shrugged . “ go naked . i usually do . ” guang - hong turned red , clamping a hand over his mouth to stifle the squeak . “ kidding , kidding ! ” chris chuckled and reached for his drink . “ i ’m sure someone has one you can borrow . ” “ o - okay . i might just … sit on the bank and watch ? ” “ do n’t like swimming ? ” guang - hong flushed and picked up his own drink . “ um … not sure . ” he cringed as he felt chris eyeing him and sighed . “ i ’ve never been . ” “ really ? huh . ” chris shrugged . “ want to learn ? ” he bit his lip as he considered . he was tempted to go back to the house and read , but he really should try to spend time with them , right ? and chris was n’t so bad . he might have actually been … not cute , but … sexy ? “ sure . ” what exactly was he getting himself into ?</td>\n",

       "      <td>united - under - skyfall : united - under - skyfall : united - under - skyfall : ignoremeatthispoint : united - under - skyfall : okay , guys , listen up . i ’ve seen a lot of hate going around for different writers ( just three examples are @hamimagines @forlifeloveandhappiness and @offiicialhamilton - and that ’s just on tumblr , and just in the world of hamilton fanfics , and just the ones i can think of off of the top of my head ) and they ’ve all been really gracious about it and dealing with it well and everything , but i ’m addressing this right here and right now . if you do n’t like their stories , do n’t f cking read them . if you do n’t like the way they ended , keep it to yourself or rant to your friends . imagine it ended some other way . do n’t give them sh t about it . if you do n’t like their lack of updates , then get over it . it ’s not your choice to dictate when they ’ll update and when they wo n’t . if you do n’t want to wait , then stop reading their stuff , imagine your own scenarios as to how it could end up going or what ’s coming next , or find something else to read for the time being . everyone on here is a normal person , just like you or me . everyone on here has a life outside of social media . sports , homework , college , extracurriculars , jobs , family , friends , pets , traveling , etc . , etc . they ’re not robots ready to write another fic every time you ’re occupied with another one just so you ’ll never run out of material to read . they have other things to be doing , and we all need to respect that . ( also , ever heard of this thing called writer ’s block ? gasp ! it exists ! and it f*cking sucks - trust me , i ’ve had it before ! ) i have n’t updated any of my wattpad fics in probably a year , and some people say they ’ll update and then do n’t for the next three to seven years ( or ever again ! ) be glad they ’re writing at all ! i know this is n’t my battle to fight for the three mentioned above , but this is an issue that not only do i feel rather close to as a writer on another site , but i ’ve seen it happen all over the place to all sorts of people , and i ’m not about to sit here while you make others feel down about themselves because you ’ve run out of reading material and need someone to take it out on ! i ’ve seen this far too much on far too many sites and something needs to be done about it , so this is me , telling you exactly what i think about all the negative things you have to say to these writers . do you know how hard it is to publish your writing for anyone in the world to see at any given time ? it ’s terrifying ! you have no idea how people will react and get extremely self conscious about your writing - nitpicking every little thing and taking out some of your favorite parts just because you think others wo n’t like it . let me tell you right now that it took me a long time to get over it , and it kept coming back to me . heck , probably the last five chapters on most of my actually published stories are all boring and pointless author ’s notes from a year ago ! i get horrible writers block and i ’ve never finished a story ! i ’ve written so many drabbles that i ’m too afraid to share with anyone and i have two wattpad accounts just so if i write something i think my friends wo n’t like , they wo n’t see it because it ’ll be on my “ closet account . ” so yeah , pretty freaking terrifying , and it ’s a major blow to my confidence every time someone even reads over my work without smiling - even worse when people criticize it . do you know how bad it makes me feel when someone calls me an * * * hole because i wo n’t update , continually badgers me about the way i write something , or says i suck at writing ? i can guarantee you right now that it makes most writers feel awful , but even though a lot of them can get over it ( sorry , i ’m not exactly one who does it easily ) , there are still some who ca n’t , or are going through something so tough that some little comment that would n’t bother you could have concussive effects on their life , and you ’d have no idea who they were before you did it or what happened once you did . i get it , you have a life , too , and you ’d like to be able to sit back and enjoy a few hours of reading - believe me , i do that all the time - but there are other sites you can find fics on , actual books you can read , ones you ’ve already read that you can reread , ones you might want to write yourself , and of course , other wonderful authors out there ! to all the writers out there who are brave enough to post their writing online ( or anywhere - or maybe not at all ) , you ’re amazing , and i really appreciate your hard work , even if i have n’t read your writing , and even if it is n’t exactly my cup of tea . do n’t let anybody get you down or tell you otherwise because even if your writing is still in it ’s developing stages , just a few weeks can do wonders for your thought process on your stories or your writing style . if you feel like you need more fics ( or non - fic stories ) to read because apparently you ca n’t handle waiting for an update from anyone on here , or you feel like you ’d like to spread your writing or need a different scene for it , then i ’d suggest , if you have n’t already tried them , either ao3 ( archivesofourown.com ) , wattpad ( wattpad.com ) , or ffn ( fanfiction.net ) okay , rant over , thanks for listening :) i ’d just like to bring this post back for @magicalcloud16 because it seems that , once again , people just are n’t getting it . do n’t listen to them ! i ’ve never read any of your works , but i ’m sure they ’re awesome ! it takes a lot of guts to post your writing on here and you should n’t let people bring you down because of it . if they do n’t like the way you do things , they can take a hike . in light of recent events concerning several different accounts on here ( i ’m so sorry @hamiltonsquills is the only one i can think of at the moment ) i ’d just like to reiterate the fact that the writer ’s on this site are not , in any way , shape or form , obligated to cater to your every will . they are not writing machines with no emotions and no other interests , they are human , and while everyone pretends to get that , i ’m seriously starting to doubt the fact that some of you do . “ how dare you treat your followers like that ” ? unfollow them if it bothers you so much . “ we ’ve been waiting so long and all we get is this crappy chapter ? ” boo hoo . cry me a river . now build a bridge and get over it . not everything they write is going to be your cup of tea , and considering how much time these people take out of their lives to write those “ crappy chapters , ” i think you can stand to wait a little longer . and another thing : if you have a problem with their work , gently tell them in a way that ’s considered constructive criticism and will actually help them in the future rather than damage their self esteem because you ’re having a bad day or their writing is n’t up to whatever standards you have . there ’s literally thousands of other things you could be reading and doing instead of complaining . “ look … we get it … . you hate yourself and you think that everyone else hates you too . but do n’t you think you should sort off keep that “ behind the curtains ” ? you ’re being such a downer and it ’s not cool . maybe if you tried being more positive more people would like you ? ? ? just keeping it real . “ excuse me ? do n’t you dare presume to know any of these people or what they ’re going through in their lives right now . it ’s their blog and they can do whatever the fuck they want with it - which means it ’s not just writing that ’s going to go up there , most of the time . this means they can rant if they want to . if it bothers you , stop looking at their posts and move on to another blog . just people liking them does n’t magically solve all of their life ’s problems , and just because someone likes them , it does n’t mean that they ca n’t argue , be mentally , physically or verbally abusive , or get into fights of one sort or another . also , in many cases , someone ’s blog would be considered “ behind the curtains , ” thank you very fucking much . “ just keeping it real ? ” you ’re telling them not to be themselves or show vulnerability and posting from a completely anonymous source at the same time , and you ’re “ just keeping it real ” ? that ’s absolutely , one hundred percent laughable and quite possibly one of the most hypocritical things i ’ve heard in my life . though it may come as news to some of you , these people have lives . yes , actual lives , where they have other things to do than writing and trying to keep you , total and complete strangers , happy with them . furthermore , yes , they are , in fact , people . they are not machines . they have school and sports and jobs and pets and family and friends and their own mental and physical health and basic every day needs like sleeping , eating and drinking that they all need to prioritize , often over their hobby writing . ( yes , even if they ’re actually an author or a journalist . most of the writing i ’ve seen on here is hobby writing , and that ’s exactly what i ’m addressing here ) sometimes , people need to vent , but have no one or nothing to vent to , and if they turn to tumblr or any other site to do it , then that ’s their choice , regardless of what you , me , or anybody else may think of it . if you start reading their post and realize it ’s simply them venting , and you ’re getting so annoyed with them doing it that much , then keep on scrolling . just as they are not obligated to write fics for you , you are not obligated to read every damn thing they post , which should eliminate any problems you have with their venting or any need for complaint . they do not owe you anything . they are their own people , and you , whoever you are and regardless of what you might think , have no right to try to dictate how they should act , what they should wear , who they should be , what they should write , what they should post or what they should do . also , i do recall running across someone saying , “ oh , do n’t tell me you ’re a feminist . i actually liked you . ” if you have a problem with their fucking view on the world , then sigh quietly to yourself and ignore it . if you ’re going to ignore everything i just said , at least do us all a favor and , if you ’re so sure that you ’re all high and mighty and know just the right solution for their problems because of course you know exactly what their lives are like , or that they owe you anything or are too slow or their writing quality sucks , then come out of the anonymous section , because from here , it looks an awful lot like cowards speaking a fool ’s language to the brave souls confident enough in their own skin to share their writing or artwork . and yes , it does take a lot of confidence or a very large push to do such a thing , because there ’s always the fear that it ’s never good enough and people will reject just like you ’ve been doing , so do n’t ii fucking dare try to tear down that confidence or make whatever they ’re going through any fucking worse . while we ’re at it , i ’d like to remind all of you that something very similar happened to a friend of ours on wattpad , and the effects were worse than any of you probably think it will be . none of us saw that coming . you have no idea if someone else will be next because of your off - the - cuff spiteful comment . think before you send . and if you wanna fucking fight someone about any of this , fight me , not them , because if you ca n’t already tell i ’m fucking ready to fight , and though i ’d much rather not , i ’d prefer you not take out your shitty day or something else and your opinions on one of them , most of whom who do absolutely nothing to deserve the hate you give them . i ’m not saying it ’s my job to jump in to any of these people ’s fights , because i ’m fully aware that they ’ve got this situation handled because they ’re all awesome , but i ’m telling you this anyways because this should be common knowledge , and , apparently , it ’s not . when people do this , it makes my blood boil , as previously mentioned in my original post , because i ’ve seen this on so many sites and it ’s just not acceptable . do n’t talk to any of them that way until you fully understand what they ’re going through in their lives and know what it ’s like to be a writer yourself . ripcanyoulikenot ( our previously mentioned wattpad friend ) somebody hold onto my crocs right fucking now i have been summoned * ties back hair * all right let ’s get down to shit . our next field trip will be to @imagineham ​ ‘s blog ( aka queen steph ) buckle up , kiddos , ‘ cause i ’m starting to get really fucking angry with all these pissy anons all over the place taking out their sour day on amazing people who do n’t fucking deserve it . “ we came here for writing , not to take a break ” excuse me ? there ’s over two hundred brilliant writers for this fucking fandom . if you in your oh - so - ignorant glory can find it in yourself the time to tell steph that she does n’t have your permission to take a break , then you can also find the time to either a ) find something else to read . did you know that there are nearly one hundred thirty million books in modern history that ’ve been published globally ? yes , my friends , one hundred thirty m i l l i o n . wow , that ’s a lot of reading . you must really have run out of reading material if you ’re so pressed for literature that you ’re banning steph from taking a break . does that mean you ’ve read all of them ? no ? oh , i did n’t think so . lookie here - there ’s this thing called a library and unless you have an incredible reading speed , are almost a hundred years old or have a photographic memory , i sincerely doubt you have read all of the surprisingly limited texts you can find in one , even for one genre . if you do n’t have a library near you , i ’m sure you know some friends or relatives who can lend you a book or two , or possibly writing of their own . even if they ’re not all your cup of tea , if someone asks you for a suggestion for one later , it might seem like the one for them , and you ’ll be glad you knew about it , wo n’t you ? you also might develop a taste for that subject or style of writing later on in life and decide to give it another try , or need something like it as a reference for something you ’re writing , a good quote , or even a speech or debate you ’re preparing for . if you for some reason ca n’t get ahold of someone who might be able to give you a book you have n’t read yet , you might have one of your own lying around . if you do n’t , then it ’s always fun to reread some of the classics or your old favorites , right ? but remember , that ’s just in actual published books - not even touching upon the realm of fanfiction or books that have n’t been actually published outside of a writing site , of which there ’s probably just as many ! once again , i offer ao3 , wattpad and ffn as alternative options . not to mention , there ’s probably well over two hundred writers in the hamilton fandom you can find just on tumblr , so you should n’t have to rely on steph . thank goodness for that - otherwise we could ’ve run into some problems , am i right ? * raises eyebrow pointedly * my point is - there ’s literally millions of options for you out there . try expanding your range a little bit . what i said earlier about rereading ? it ’s not like that ’s taboo or anything . you can do it in the fanfic world , too . as far as i can tell , steph may be taking a break , but she ’s not planning on deleting all of her writing . calm down . they ’re not going anywhere . if you need some help finding writers in the hamilton fandom , i will personally post all of the hamilton writers i follow ( it ’s a lot , but it ’s certainly not all of them ) so you can find some sort of a basis to go with . i ’m sure there ’s at least one or two awesome users who you have n’t seen yet . b ) realize that sometimes a writer needs to take a break . steph is literally amazing and she ’s helped so many writers , artists and users who she does n’t even know by sending them encouraging messages , always being upbeat , and producing tons of fics on her own free time . she did n’t need to do any of that . she could go around telling everyone how atrocious their sense of humor is , or how awful their writing is and how stupid their artwork is and constantly post about how she hates the world and everyone in it and rip on others like you ’re doing to her and post a thirty word fic that ’s literally just a jumble of words every five and a half months . but she does n’t . which do you prefer ? when you do this to writers and discourage them from taking breaks and put pressure on them to finish stories and then immediately start writing another one , somehow assuming it to be possible that they can do so without needing a break , you ’re only making it worse for yourself as a reader . it puts stress on the writer that they do n’t need , especially when for most people who write on these sites , writing is supposed to be a stress reliever . instead of taking the time they need to write fics that they feel good about themselves and that you actually enjoy from them in the first place , which can take anywhere from a day to several months for a single short story , they ’ll rush , because you ’re expecting them to please you with more more more , which makes their fics sloppier than normal , something they ’re not happy with , and something you are n’t happy with , either . maybe i should ’ve addressed this first - a writer holds absolutely no obligation to their readers . sure , maybe a professional writer does , because it ’s literally their job to make readers happy and keep buying their works , but the writers on these sites do it for the pure enjoyment , and trying to turn their creative process into something you can control on a timer takes that away from them . you ’re only going to make them hate something they love , and that is a truly disgraceful thing to do . when you put this pressure on them to write quicker , i can almost guarantee you that it ’ll never turn out as well as they would ’ve liked it , which will always linger in the back of their minds . in addition to this , because it probably wo n’t be up to their usual standards , it ’s probably not whatever quality of writing you ’re used to seeing from them , and that ’s only going to make you disappointed or angry with them , which many of you will tell them , which will only make them disappointed or angry with theirselves , which will stress them out even more and is n’t good for their mental , and by extension , physical health . do you see where i ’m going here ? it ’s a vicious cycle . you may not see it in steph yet , nor may you ever , but if you do this to writers , ninety nine percent of the time , you ’re eventually going to see a downwards spiral in their writing . that ’s because by being rude , hurtful and pressuring , you ’re making them feel worse about themselves and their work , and that ’s going to , at some level , be reflected in their writing . writers have a life to worry about , too . pets that need taking care of . family members and friends that want to see them , need help getting around or need someone to look after them . jobs that they have to get to to pay the bills , keep on their feet and survive , and school and classes that have to take priority to get those jobs , or that they would n’t need jobs if they did n’t have them . they have to eat , drink , sleep and relieve themselves , all to stay healthy and stay alive . a lot of people who might ’ve taken the time to read this are probably rolling their eyes at the face that i added that part , because it should ’ve been obvious , but i feel that it needed to be said . many writers i know on this site suffer from social anxiety , anxiety in general , depression , or are suffering through a loved one they ’ve lost somehow . many of them have to do different physical and mental exercises that they have to remember to do as well as medicine that they have to remember to take to keep them focused , keep them from doing something drastic , and again , just to keep themselves healthy in general , for a number of different reasons i do n’t pretend to know . if they write as often as you want them to , then a number of things could happen . 1 . ) they might skip meals , which goes without saying is very unhealthy , especially if such a thing becomes a habit . 2 . ) they ’ll probably cut back on sleep , which is n’t healthy , either , and makes it harder to focus and function in school and at work . 3 . ) they ’ll become distant from their friends and family . this is n’t good for their social life . humans crave human company . if you push away those closest to you , it ’s really hard to find those connections again , especially if you have anxiety and/or social anxiety like some might , or something similar , which can make talking to new people , making friends and rebuilding relationships hard . 4 . ) they could forget to take mandatory meds , which considering the vast , diverse population of the world , could lead to any number of unforeseeable problems . all of this is n’t good for their mental or physical health . they can get unexplained pains . they can become dehydrated and/or malnourished . they ’ll not get enough sleep , which can be just as bad as not getting enough food or water . the skipped medicine i wo n’t even go into , as there ’s hundreds of things that could happen . overall , they wo n’t be in good shape . they ’ll be stressed , snappish , tired , emotional , and some might even do something as drastic as self harm or committing suicide . scary thought , right ? even scarier of a thought to think that you might actually be a factor to it , i ’m sure . you do n’t think it will happen until it actually does . if you ’re so on their case about them writing , then i ’m sure you ’d rather have a writer on the other side of the screen then an empty chair , someone coming to deliver the bad news to you , or someone coming to delete their blog , would n’t you ? breaks can do wonders for the human mind , one ’s overall mood , and the creative process , whether that break is only five minutes or as long as five years . you ca n’t tell people what to do and what not to do , especially if it ’s over the internet , where you do n’t even really know them . steph , as well as everyone else here , can do whatever the hell they want , especially if it ’s in the best interest of their physical and mental health , and you ’re not one to tell them otherwise , no matter who they are . i realize this may sound hypocritical , because i ’m telling you not to hate on writers or be pressuring to them . i ’m not telling you that you ca n’t . i ’m sure multiple people will turn around and send me rude messages in response to this , saying i have no clue what i ’m talking about , and that ’s fine by me , so long as you do n’t do it to anyone else . i ’m simply trying to drill into your minds what your little moments of irritation and a quick impulse message can do . this means that no one owes you anything , no matter how much you might think it . c ) to realize : yes , we realize you went there for the fics . but fics are more like admission fees and awesome writers , both in their writing and outside of it , are more like food . ( i ’m not saying you should eat them . i like my writing friends to be perfectly alive and uneaten , thank you very much . ) and , of course , like my friends are fond of saying when we try to advertise our school ’s dances ( joy oh joy , perks of being on student council ) : come for the admission fee , stay for the food ! if it does n’t make sense then i ’m afraid you just are n’t going to get it . “ but you ca n’t go ! we need your fics ! ” i ’m sorry , but i googled it , and apparently there ’s no way to change fics into world peace , water , oxygen , money for the poor , happiness or shelter . check again next week . in conclusion : breaks : are good , and we should all take one once in awhile . writers : can do whatever the hell they want . rude anons : can fuck off . “ just because you like my stuff does n’t mean i owe you anything . ” ~bob dylan p.s . i did tell you i ’d be ready to fight someone . you just made the mistake of taking the fight to steph first . i literally spent an hour and a half writing just this most recent add - on to this post . do not underestimate me because i really have so much to say on this topic . and , because i promised , but just for hamilton writers ( and a few others in the fandom to help keep you busy ) because honestly i do n’t follow enough people from other fandoms to really be of any help there ( but if there ’s anybody who runs across this and has a good base to cover for any other fandoms , or indeed , more from the hamilton fandom as well , please add it to this , because i know writer hate happens everywhere and i ’d like it to stop in as many places as possible ) : i ’m sorry if this annoys some of the writers being tagged , but please understand i ’m really trying to help with the writer hate and i ’m hoping if i give people a good selection they wo n’t feel the need to hate on other writers because they are n’t posting fics or they are n’t   “ good enough ” for them and that they can just keep it to themselves and find a fic from a different writer . @a - schuylerr @adothoe @alexanderhamllton @and - peggy - yall @building - palaces - from - paragraphs @completehamiltontrash @coolbeanbinch @damn - man - ham - fam @daveeddiggsit @daveedsponytail @dearhamiltons @diggs4life @dont - be - petty - be - peggy @elizabethschxyler @exhibits - no - restraint @fanfrickinhamiltasticimagines @forlifeloveandhappiness @gratitudejoyandsorrow @ham - iltonima - gines @hamil - garbage @hamil - tons @hamilton - noodles @hamilton4laurens @hamiltonimaginess @hamiltonimaginessss @hamiltonmagines @hamiltonwrotetheother51 @hamiltonxoneshot @hamimagines @hamitome – imagines @hamlltvn @hamwriters @helplessly - burning @helplesslylins @hercules - mullifan @iamnotthrowingawaymyshit @imagineham @imagines - hamilton @imagining - haamilton @imwillingtowriteforit @insane - hamilton - imagines @iputmyselfintothenarrative @ithoughtyouweredifferent @its - the - hamfam @iwrotemywayto - revolution @keepingupwithlinmanuel @l - nmanuel @linmanuel - istheman - da @literallylin @lookaroundlookaroundhowlucky @love - doesnt - discriminate @manuelmirandamn @manuelmiranduh @marquis - de - labaguette @matt10nt @moarhamiltonxreader @momentsthatthewordsdontreach @more - ham - imagines @musicalmiranda @myalexanderhamiltonjustyouwait @nobeatnomelody @nonstop - laurens @not - angelica - schuyler @notthrowingawaymymemes @on - written - wings @onlytolive @oogeeky - girlyoo @ourforgottenboleros @pastpatientlywaitingforimagines @please - say - hamilton @protecting - my - legacy @psychedemigod @running - out - of - time - imagines @ruth - hamilton - delrio @saynotofics @secretschuylersister @sevenisalivingmeme @strongenoughfoundation @sunshinemiranda @tenduelimagines @thatoneimaginesblog @theimaginesofhamilton @theroomwhereitswritten @timeforhamilton @ton - of - ham @womenarethesequel @writingiseasier @yayhamletnonstop @yourobedientslytherin there you go , eighty eight hamilton writers or hamilton fandom related blogs i have separated from the list of blogs i follow . all of them are amazing , and i have helpfully alphabetized them for you . remember there are hundreds of others . you have literally no excuse for giving them hate because   “ they are n’t updating fast enough ” or   “ their writing was n’t good enough ” or anything of that caliber , when there ’s so many other things you could be reading , as well as so many other things you could be doing instead of reading if you really and truly have run out of things to read . better yet , go visit @a - hurricane - came and leave any hate or complaints you have there , because that ’s my blog , and i ’d be happy to take any hate or complaints you have there if it means other writers are n’t going to be getting it . this is really important and everyone should take a minute of their time to read it ! writing is a pastime for most of us , not a job . it does n’t matter if you post a new fic per day or per week or only had posted one , you ’re awesome for doing it and do n’t deserve to be told otherwise ! so if you need it , listen to eliza and take a break . no one has the right to send hateful comments to you for the mere fact of being human and having necessities ( ’cause no , you ca n’t survive just by writing ) . just ignore them and keep being the wonderful person you are!~    ♡ ♡ thanks so much for tagging me in this , let ’s spread the love for all the beautiful writers !</td>\n",

in an attempt to even the playing - field , cas has been doing his yoga every morning in his boxers - briefs in the living room ( long before sam wakes up , but just in time for dean to stumble out of the bedroom to get his first cup of coffee while cas is in a full - straddle forward fold , the wheel pose , or , his personal favorite , the reclining bound angel ) . so far he ’s been tackled twice by dean who ’s flimsy excuse of “ i tripped on the rug ” did n’t play either time . however , despite his nearly - naked yoga and pictures sent of himself riding his favorite dildo , castiel is severely outmatched . dean is just too sexy , and he knows all of the buttons to push . he knows that he can almost level cas with a hungry stare from across the room . he knows that cas likes it rough and has no second thoughts about pushing cas into a wall or against the door and kissing him or spanking him hard as they walk by each other . hell , cas has been fondled and groped in every quiet corner of the house , even while sam ’s been home and the only thing keeping him quiet are two of dean ’s thick fingers shoved in his mouth . yesterday , dean had snuck up behind him and wrapped a hand around his throat , squeezing just enough to make cas’ heart rate spike up . “ do n’t touch yourself tonight . or tomorrow . can you do that for me ? ” dean had whispered quietly as sam was only a few feet away . cas whimpered and nodded , very sure of what he was agreeing to . dean squeezed his throat a little harder , drawing a whine out of cas , and then said , “ good boy , ” before licking the shell of his ear . cas nearly came in his pants . and tonight sam was staying with his girlfriend . evidently dean was n’t going to waste a second of their alone time . “ i wonder how many times i can make you come before he gets home tomorrow . ” dean breaks the kiss and growls out the words in a low rumble against cas’ lips . it makes him shudder and his head knocks against the wall behind him with a thud . “ think i can get you to black out again ? ” cas groans with that memory but he does n’t want to come across as easy so he teases dean with “ i do n’t know , you might be losing your touch … ” then dean easily strips off cas’ shirt and tosses it to the side . “ dean … ” cas whines , now definitely sounding easy and desperate for whatever dean will give him . “ man , you made some beautiful sounds that night . you sang for me baby , you remember that ? ” dean seems lost in the memory , too . “ man , i wish i’da recorded that … ” continue reading on ao3</td>\n",

( my best work ) nsfw smuttery - here &amp; here . if you want to see more examples , let me know . some feedback from people who have privately commissioned me in the past : “ mello always delivers when it comes to writing .   he ’s written a few stories for me before .   i always received them promptly and they were very high quality .   10/10 would recommend . ” - @kingcandy ​ “ mello wrote me a long , steamy fanfic in less than 24 hours ! how ? ! ” - @bumblepuppy ​ “ i ’ve known mello for years and his writing has only gotten better over time ! not only has he written five stories for me ( six if you count the story my gf bought for me : ’ ) ) , he ’s helped me edit in the past . mello has a really speedy turnaround , even for the fic for a movie he had n’t seen . he takes care when it comes to writing stuff for other people , making sure to add in little details ( though , it might ’ve been easy with me since i ’m an open fucking book and he knows me ) that make a great fic all the better . the times that he ’s written for me , he has n’t judged me at all for my weird specific kinks ( at least , in a serious non - friendly way he has nt , lmfao . he ’s a professional and all as well so ! ! ) so you do n’t have to worry about that sort of thing . i highly recommend him if you want some good fuckin shit ™ . ” - @rockmacbeth ​ in terms of pricing … .. 1500 - 3000 words : £ 10 3000 - 4500 words : £ 17 4500 - 6000 words : £ 24 6000 - 7500 words : £ 30 7500 + words : £ 30 base , and an extra £ 6 per 1500 words . for smut / nsfw : 1500 - 3000 words : £ 13 3000 - 4500 words : £ 20 4500 - 6000 words : £ 28 6000 - 7500 words : £ 34 7500 + words : message me first , we ’ll talk . in theory , i ’m happy to write you something of any length . i can and will write you a novel if you have the money for it . if you ask for something in the 3k-4.5k area , say , and it ends up being 4.7k i will not charge you for the extra . sometimes i end up writing more than i expected , but whatever price we agree on is what you pay . i can only really take money through paypal at this time , so paypal it ’ll be . as for what i will write , i will work with any fandom and any original characters . if i do not know the canon , i ’ll do my research , but if you can tell me about your personal experience of the characters , it ’ll help ! i will write fanfiction , original fiction , or canon / oc fiction and pairings . i will write basically any ship , setting , or au . i ’ll do you your original characters in your own universe if you want to see someone else handle them . i ’ll write you the 20k slow burn of your oc and your video game lovely . whatever you like ! just drop me a message . that said , there are a couple of small things i ca n’t / wo n’t do . no non - con , or essentially non - con ( including anything where one person could not reasonably give consent ) . furry stuff i ca n’t really do , i ’m afraid , not my area . nothing that ’s like outright racist or sexist or transphobic or what have you . i also wo n’t write you anything nsfw if you ’re under eighteen . on the other hand , i am fine with gore . i ’m a horror writer , so anything disturbing ( in that sense ) is fine by me . as for specific kinks , you ’d have to ask , but i consider myself open - minded . for other people i ’ve written crossdressing , eye - licking , cherry popping , and puke , among others , so take that how you will . please send me a message if you are interested ! in an initial message , i mostly want to know the type of thing you want written and the length / price you had in mind . we can discuss it in more detail after that . my asks and messaging are both open . if you ’re curious about whether i ’ll write something , but are shy to ask , you can send me an anon . other than that , please reblog this post to help me get some spread ! thank you very much !</td>\n",

your name , for example the one where you get the name of the person in their handwriting on your body somewhere at a certain age the one where the first thing they say to you appears instead the one where you get each others’ fingerprints the one where you get matching marks / symbols / tattoos the one where your marks or words that change depending on what ’s going on with your soulmate(s ) the one with the clock that counts down the time until you meet your soulmate(s ) ( multiple clock for multiple soulmates ? one click until you meet them both ? unexpected third soulmate showing up after the clocks drop ? ) the one where when you sleep you dream of whatever they ’re experiencing from their point of view until you find them , or after you find them the one where you can straight up talk to them in dreams until / after you find them the one where you form a telepathic / empathetic link until / after you find them the one where you share extreme physical sensation until / after you find them ; if one of you hurts the other one hurts , if one of you is getting lucky the other one gets a little hot and bothered the one where the closer you are to them the more aware of them you become , and you find them playing a hot / cold game ;

characters who have been through trauma who do n’t want to touch people hard of hearing characters like clint barton who ca n’t hear their soulmate speak without hearing aids / at all or on the flipside   characters who ca n’t speak ; maybe it still works in sign language , or maybe it does n’t people who ca n’t read / can’t read the language the words on their body are in characters like bucky barnes who ’ve lost hands and/or had their fingerprints removed soulmate clocks that time out in the middle of the crowd ; there ’s an entire craigslist category for finding who else was there that day with a clock that timed out too famous characters speaking to or performing for a crowd and suddenly their world is in color / their clock times out / etc and every member of the audience pretends to be this celebrity ’s soulmate and a cinderella type situation ensues with the finding soulmates playing the hot / cold game and they keep missing each other insomniacs who rarely sleep , much less at the same time / different time than their soulmates soulmate ot3s / ot4s / otmores where you dream in varying people ’s povs every time you sleep and get super confused people who get sick or injured and frantically search for their soulmates   so they can survive people who need to be in medically induced comas and their soulmates have to stay away so they do n’t accidentally wake them up the one where soulbonding is actually a choice and someone chooses to bond with someone they may not know or like to save their lives and have to figure out if they can unbond or if they have to live with the situation ( and of course learn to love one another either romantically or not ) new souls who do n’t get memories of past lives because they do n’t have one and panic muggles / people without powers who of course ca n’t get them upgraded or unlocked combination aus : the one where you one or both of you have to do all three ( see your soulmate(s ) , touch your soulmate(s ) , hear your soulmate(s ) ) , or all three have to happen at least once between the 2 + of you or it ’s completely random how you find your soulmate(s ) : one of you gets a name and the other gets a fingerprint , one of you has to hear your soulmate and one of you has to see them , etc ; particularly useful if you happen to be blind or deaf same for characters with other disabilities / who have “ complications ” : they get or find a different way of finding their soulmates , not better or worse , just different then there ’s soulmate aus that do n’t have to conform to lifelong monogamy : the ones where you have more than one romantic soulmate at the same time or you get a new soulmate after the first dies the ones where people have multiple soulmates of different types and it ’s color coded ; a red name / mark / etc for love , a blue one for friendship , etc ; for the ones where you start seeing color you get a new one for each soulmate the ones where some people have romantic soulmates and some do n’t , and those that do n’t are still perfectly happy anyway , maybe in a relationship anyway , maybe not the ones where some people have multiple romantic soulmates who may or may not also be soulmates with each other aromantic or asexual people who have soulmates who are not and they manage to work it out romantic and sexual people who do n’t have soulmates but find happiness anyway , either with someone like them or someone not like them soulmate aus that explore the ramifications of soulmates being a thing : the ones where soulmates are for everyone and get legal aid to help stay together , like if their in - laws try to keep them apart / someone risks getting deported / someone gets drafted / whatever the ones where soulmates are super super rare and technically get exempted from shitty things like “ people of different races / the same sex / etc ca n’t get married / have relations / etc ” but maybe still face a lot of prejudice and they fight to get those types of awful laws lifted for everyone agencies that exist to help you find your soulmate(s ) or   figure out which soulmate thing you have   but some of them are just shams , bonus points for this being in a verse where the thing is exceedingly rare to begin with people pretending to be soulmates to take advantage of the laws , for good or ill ; the couple who loves just as fiercely as a soulmates who will do anything to stay together , or the shitty people who try to claim they ’re mated to people who ’ve rejected them so they “ have ” to stay together tabloid mags photoshopping matching soulmate marks or following big legal cases where someone tries to prove or disprove that they are soulmates with someone else soulmates in universes where they ’re a rarity or rare soulmate types like ot3s / ot4s / otmores in dodging government officials because they do n’t want to become lab rats people who do n’t believe in soulmates until it happens to them , or people who believe hardcore and want to find theirs but they do n’t necessarily have one , or do n’t have a romantic one little rituals that make finding your soulmate more likely , like shaking hands with people as often as possible even with the cashier ringing up your groceries , repeating each other ’s names after you ’re introduced , etc just give me alllll the soulmate aus ok , give me people finding each other in spite of complications , give me all the delightful plot twists , give me detailed worlds where this changes the norms , give me it working out in the end whether romantically or not , bonded or not feel free to reblog with sources ! ( or more aus . ) a little over half of these are things i ’ve seen elsewhere over time and i can not remember where they are all from haha or if you ’re into this sorta thing    you could just take pity on me and reblog it anyway this took an embarrassingly long time to type up oh my god ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;</td>\n",

( mobile and tablet users please see the ending notes)’ in html mode in ao3 , ( if you try this in rich text mode you will get a horrible mess so do n’t ) the line with this example would appear as : &lt; p&gt;“&lt;em &gt; qu’est ce que tu veux?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p &gt; to add the floating box with the translation , you would select the words to be translated ( that is , qu’est ce que tu veux ? ) and paste in the following html . &lt; span title=“what do you want?”&gt;qu’est ce que tu veux?&lt;/span &gt; the whole line will now read : &lt; p&gt;“&lt;em &gt; &lt; span title=“what do you want?”&gt;qu’est ce que tu veux?&lt;/span &gt; &lt; /em&gt;”&lt;/p &gt; review your work , hover over the part that requires translating , and you should see the following : and you ’re done ! i tend to set up a word doc with all the &lt; span &gt; lines i want to use created in it , and then when the time comes , just copy / paste them into ao3 . saves lots of time ! @yellowflicker09011996 relevaaaaaaaant ! ! ! !</td>\n",

       "      <td>3rdgymbros : a / n : okay , so this fanfiction of lou and alabaster ( being bros ) is dedicated to @alexfierrno who has always been very kind , loving and supportive to everyone . i really appreciate you replying to every single one of my messages , and thank you for making my time at tumblr such a bright and positive experience . lou ’s grown used to not having her brother around , but every now and then , she ’ll be reminded of what she had and what they could have been . posted on ao3 and fanfiction.net lou ellen sprinted ahead of alabaster , across the park to the playground and immediately swarmed up the cone - shaped rope climbing frame . alabaster followed through the gate , found the nearest bench and sat down . he checked his watch , but it was n’t time to head back to camp yet . “ see , alabaster , i can do this one too ! ” lou called to him , hanging off the pinnacle and waving . alabaster waved back . at the age of twelve , alabaster considered himself too old to be swinging about on monkey bars , but he had n’t really minded when lou had clamored to visit a playground . ( ethan had snickered and called him whipped , and alabaster had glared , but had been unable to come up with a suitable retort . ) she ’d dragged him half - way across new york to her desired destination , excitedly chattering about the long , curved slides and the wooden playground structure made to look like a pirate ship , complete with a plank and a billowing black flag , adorned with the iconic skull and cross - bones . the heavy grey skies meant that the play park was devoid of other children , although some hardy souls were playing football in the adjoining field . “ you ’re not watching ! ” “ sorry , lou . ” he offered lou a faint smile , watching his younger sister , who was now trying to balance on one foot on the slender rope , the toes of her other foot pointed like a ballerina ’s . “ be careful , okay ? ” “ do n’t worry , i can fly ! ” but you ca n’t , alabaster thought , halfway off the bench , poised to run and catch lou if she fell . lou put both her feet back on the rope and he sat back down on the bench , heaving a silent sigh of relief . “ watch this ! ” “ okay . ” “ look , no hands ! whoops ! ” instinctively , he was off the bench again , but lou managed to catch herself . lou threw her head back and laughed , thrilled , alabaster much less so . he debated calling ethan for back - up , but the son of nemesis would probably laugh at him and encourage lou for good measure . alabaster settled for calling out a warning instead . “ lou , be careful ! ” “ i am ! ” her response elicited an incredulous stare from him , to which lou smiled innocently , looking as though butter would n’t melt in her mouth . alabaster stifled a groan . he had nectar and ambrosia in his pack , but he ’d prefer to have a whole day pass without having to use it for a change . “ lou . ” “ okay , okay ! ” on the climbing frame , lou was pushing her feet one way on the rope and her hands the other way on the central pole , making the cone spin on its axis . her entire attention was on going as fast as possible . chocolate brown curls tumbled around her face and her dull green jacket was half open . deciding that the frame was spinning as fast as possible , lou scrambled down and jumped off . she landed with a happy whoosh , sure on both feet , and ran to the swings . soon , lou ’s shrieks of happiness reached alabaster ’s ears . his shoulders relaxed and his soul smiled . it was so rare that lou got to act like a normal child , running and laughing like an average seven - year old , without the world resting on those slender shoulders for a change . he ’d tried to shield her from some of the more cruel taunts – “ freak ” , “ witch ” – but there was only so much he could do . some of the kids at camp could be cruel , especially when lou , still unable to control her own magic , had accidentally turned some of them into frogs and polecats . the campers – even their own cabin mates – had given lou a wide berth after that . they ’d avoided her as though she were contagious . so much for family loyalty . lou did n’t let it bother her for the most part , but there were the bad days when she would cry , quiet and heartbreaking sniffles into her pillow at night when all the hushed whispers and giggles had faded away . those were the nights when he would crawl into her single bed and stroke her hair until she fell asleep , sobs ebbing away into quiet inhales and exhales . when he would think about how twisted the gods were , to so callously ignore one of their blatantly unhappy children . if they really were all - knowing and all - seeing , could n’t they at least spend five minutes comforting a crying child ? sometimes , alabaster wondered who the real monsters were . “ alabaster ! ” panting , lou came running up from the swings , her curls bouncing , face flushed and eyes bright . “ do you have my water bottle ? ” he forced a smile , aware of keen emerald eyes trained onto his face . alabaster produced it . lou took a long drink , wiping her mouth on her sleeve when she was done . “ not on your sleeve , please , lou , ” alabaster chided gently , wiping that round and damp face with a clean handkerchief . lou pulled a face , but obliged . she handed the bottle and the cap back to him separately . “ come and push me , ” she said , and sprinted back to the swings . alabaster got up to join her . “ lou ellen ? ” that ’s not alabaster . her name is accompanied with a hesitant poke to her forearm . lou ellen wakes with a start , feeling rough bark press into her spine . she ’s crying . lou ellen ’s head is turned to the side , her long lashes forming dark crescents , but the hot tears push through unrelentingly . she touches a cheek that is glistening wet and in her mind comes a refrain that sounds eerily like alabaster ’s voice : do n’t cry , lou . do n’t cry . please do n’t cry . everything ’s going to be okay . lou ellen looks up at nico and hazel , their faces identical pictures of concern . for a moment she flashes back to alabaster . she looks nico in the eyes and for a minute , has difficulty focusing . “ yes ? ” “ you fell asleep . it ’s time for dinner . ” “ okay . ” hazel ’s eyes slide from nico to lou ellen as she speaks . “ you ’re crying . ” “ okay . ” “ we ’ll see you at the dining pavilion ? ” hazel ’s smiling , but there ’s a hint of uncertainty in her voice . “ we could save you a seat . ” “ okay . ” lou ellen watches them walk away , hand - in - hand down the gravel path with its russet - colored trees . hazel ’s wearing a skirt in some kind of pale , floaty material , and her purple spqr t - shirt . she ’s talking to nico , and her face is tilted up to his . nico cracks a rare smile as he bends down to listen . the effect is a kodak moment , filled with love and joy , and happiness . lou ellen feels as though she ’s been punched in the gut . she ’d been like that too , once upon a time . “ i ’m your big brother now . that means we ’re family . and we ’re all going to stick together . ” “ forever and ever ? ” “ forever and ever . ” i had a brother , she thinks , in something akin to a mingled sense of jealousy and despair . i had a brother , but he was taken away . lou ellen closes her eyes . she has a blinding headache .</td>\n",

       "      <td>from heaven and back : chapter 2 chapter one here rainy days were some of the best days , at least in marinette ’s mind . there was nothing like watching the city get a good shower . the rain washed away dirt and grime , much like ladybug ’s lucky charm cleansed the city after an akuma attack . the smell of fresh rain was so pure and refreshing . there was also the fact that marinette fell head - over - heals for adrien on a rainy day . just the smell of rain brought the memories fresh to her mind . the way their hands had brushed when she reached for his umbrella . the way his laugh sent chills down her spine . the familiar feeling that spread across her chest . marinette felt like she already knew him . “ marinette ? ” a small voice sounded , pulling the girl from her thoughts . she looked away from her bedroom window to see tikki , her faithful kawami , hovering near her shoulder . “ what is it tikki ? ” marinette questioned . “ do n’t you think we should hurry up ? ” the pixie flew over to the girl ’s phone and tapped it . “ we do n’t want you to be later than we already are . ladybug ca n’t be grounded . ” marinette rushed over , taking the phone and bringing it close to her face . “ what ! ” the girl shouted in panic . “ is it already that late ? argh ! ” she dashed over to her desk and began throwing stuff into her bag . “ just once , i ’d like not to be rushed ! is that too much to ask for ? ” the girl looked to her kawami for an answer but all she got was an unsympathetic giggle . marinette groaned , slinging her bag over her shoulder . “ come on tikki ! we got ta go ! ” marinette paused only long enough for the pixie to fly inside her bag . flinging open the trap door she took the stairs down two by two . “ wait ! marine … ” vipp thump thump thump “ ow … . ” marinette groaned . her body cried out in pain as she pushed herself up from the floor . the pixie sighed . “ i ’m sorry marinette . i tried to warn you . ” “ thanks , tikki . i appreciate the effort . ” the poor girl moaned , forced herself up and hobbled out the door , rubbing her bruises along the way . adrien watched the rain as it drizzled down the car window on his way to school . he was about a half hour late because of a photo shoot . the rhythm of the rain falling was depressing . adrien felt like he had a huge cloud of gloom above his head . rainy days were n’t adrien ’s favorite . one of the side effects of being chat noir is that the rain made him feel lazy and unfocused . but it was more than that . rainy days held mixed feelings for the poor sunshine child . adrien ’s mother had disappeared on a rainy day . she had kissed his head affectionately right before his morning lessons . as she left for a meeting it started to rain . adrien did n’t think anything of it , till she never came home . ever since that day , the rain weighed heavily on his heart . though , it was also the rain that made him think of marinette . how they became friends . how she had made him laugh . he had n’t laughed like that in so long . her laugh had resonated through him like a wave . it chased away the sadness and uncertainty that held so tightly to him . marinette made him feel confident . she seemed so familiar and safe . “ hey , kid . you still with me ? ” the blonde jumped at the muffled voice coming from his jacket . adrien opened his jacket slightly , peering at the small flying cat inside . “ yeah plagg , i ’m here . what ’s up ? ” “ were you having another ladybug daydream ? ” the kawami asked with a mischievous look . “ what ? no ! ” adrien exclaimed ! his cheeks flushed red at the mention of his polka - dotted love . the flying cat cocked an eyebrow skeptically . “ ahuh , sure you were n’t . ” plagg left the confines of the jacket to hover in front of the flustered boy . “ you have that look again . ” “ what look ? ” “ you always make this twitterpated look when you ’re thinking about ladybug . it ’s painful just watching you make it . ” the black pixie held his head dramatically as he spoke . “ i do n’t know what you ’re talking about . and for your information , i was thinking about marinette , not ladybug ! so ha ! ” adrien smirked , crossing his arms triumphantly . he ’d won this argument . plagg just closed his eyes and shook his head . ‘ these dumb kids are gunna’ drive me crazy ! just how thick can they be?’ he internally complained . “ what ? ” adrien asked as the car slowed to a halt . “ nothing . just do n’t let me get wet ! ” plagg hissed and flew back into adrien ’s jacket . adrien could n’t help but feel like he was missing something . but he would have to figure that out later . he was already late . adrien grabbed his bag and umbrella and slipped out of the car . he gave his driver a wave and the man drove away . the boy began making his way to the school . honk honk honk the blonde jumped at the sounds of a car horn . adrien turned to face the sound . he discarded his bag and umbrella making him ready to run and transform in an instant . what he was not ready for was something to hit him square in the chest . “ oomph . ” was the sound that escaped adrien ’s lungs as he hit the wet cement . his back cried out in agony . his head spun like an old record . it was his lungs that hurt the worst . they felt flat like there was an extra weight pushing down on them . adrien wheezed slightly . man , it never hurt this bad when he was wearing chat ’s suit . after a few seconds , adrien gathered the strength to prop himself up on his elbows . he looked down at his chest . he saw hair … black hair … it looked kinda’ like … ladybug ’s ! adrien ’s eyes widened . could it be her ? he blushed . plagg was right , he really was twitterpated . “ ug … ” the girl whimpered , slowly rising to her hands and knees . adrien held his breath . the girl looked up , eyes meeting his . “ ma … marinette ? ” adrien was surprised to say the least . it was not his lady , but someone just as sweet , who had run into him . he coughed , clearing his throat . “ marinette ! are you okay ? ” marinette was not okay . she was having an internal meltdown ! she had just run into adrien agreste ! sure she had missed the car , thanks to her ladybug skills , but she had run smack dab into adrien ! and to make matters worse , she ’d fallen on top of him ! on top ! what idiot had condemned her to this horrible fate ? who ever thought ‘ oh , i ’m going to make marinette a clumsy prone girl with an overactive emotional state.’ was an idiot ! “ marinette ? ” adrien called waving a hand in front of her face . “ can you hear me ? ” “ huh ? what ? ” marinette came back to the real world . she had been staring into space . adrien head called her name several times to no avail . not even the rain soaking them was enough to bring her too . it was adrien ’s touch that got her attention . adrien had sat up and now had both his hands on marinette ’s shoulders . he ’d maneuvered her to sit on her own bent legs . he was studying her critically , a single eyebrow raised in concern . “ i asked you how you were feeling ? that was a pretty rough landing . ” adrien ’s hands slowly slipped from marinette ’s shoulders as he spoke . marinette ’s blush deepened . he was so close to her . she could see the intensity in his eyes . it reminded her of a certain black cat she knew . “ oh , i ’m not sane . ” marinette smiled . it was n’t till adrien ’s look grew more worried that she realized her mistake . marinette began rushing words out as fast as she could , her hands moving wildly as she spoke . “ i mean not in pain ! because - i’m - sane ! well - most - of - the - time - but - that - doesn’t - matter - right - now - because - i’m - sane - and - not - in - pain - and - you - don’t - need - to - worry - about - me ! hehehe … ” there was an awkward silence between the two teens . adrien was staring at marinette with a bewildered look . marinette was internally screaming at herself for messing up in front of adrien , again ! it was adrien who broke the uneasy silence by chuckling . “ marinette , you have to be one of the funniest people i ’ve ever met ! ” “ re .. really ? ” the embarrassed girl was taken aback . she knew adrien was the kindest boy she ’d ever met , but he still managed to amazer her . “ really ! ” adrien smiled at her , the same smile he ’d given her when they ’d first become friends . “ you ’re hiss - terical ! ” marinette was shocked ! did adrien agrest just use a patented chat noir pun ? “ i did n’t know you … um , were a fan of chat noir ’s puns … ” “ what ? ” adrien jumped slightly at the mention of chat noir . “ you … um … you just used a chat pun . ” “ i did ? ” “ uh - huh . you said ' hiss - terical’ . ” marinette naturally did chat ’s mannerisms as she purred the pun . “ o … or … something like that … ” adrien blushed . he was flattered that she knew his super hero persona so well after only a few encounters . she had his mannerisms down to an art . now if she just took some punning lessons , from your ’s truly , she would n’t make a half - bad chat noir . adrien smiled . not that he would ever give up his miraculous . “ huh , i guess i did . he must have infected me or something . ” adrien rubbed the back of his head nervously . he had to be more careful or he ’d be found out . then ladybug would have his tail . “ yeah , he does tend to have that kind of effect . ” marinette giggled slightly . “ we , uh , should head inside . we do n’t want to catch a cold . ” the rain was really starting to soak adrien ’s hair and clothes .    plagg would certainly have words to say about this later . the blonde looked over to see marinette was in the same boat . “ oh , yeah . we should . ” adrien stood up and offered his hand to marinette . she took it hesitantly and he pulled her up . he held her hand just a little bit longer than he needed too , though neither of the teens seemed to mind . “ th … thank you … ” marinette stuttered as he let go of her hand . both teens gathered their things . adrien grabbed his umbrella and dumped out the pool of water that was forming in it . he shook it out and brought it over to cover both marinette and himself . “ shall we ? ” the blonde asked . marinette just nodded in response . she was far too nervous to actually speak . they began making their way up the steps walking in sync with each other and the rain marinette walked rigidly as she tried not to invade adrien ’s personal space . adrien was way more relaxed as they walked . they had almost reached the large door when adrien looked down to see his shadow . “ hmm ? ” he hummed . where there was a shadow there was light . the boy turned around peering at the rainy city scape . “ wow ! hey marinette , look ! ” marinette turned around and let out a small gasp . “ it ’s beautiful ! ” the two watched as the clouds parted and a rainbow fell down from the sky . it painted itself perfectly across the city , landing right at the base of the eiffel tower . it was breathtaking , like something out of a fairytale . adrien stole a side glance at his friend . she wore a look of pure awe that made his heart skip a beat . for just a second , he thought he ’d seen ladybug . adrien shook his head . he was about to look away when something made him look closer . there , in marinette ’s eyes was a rainbow . how was that even possible ? “ it .. it ’s pretty … do n’t you think ? ” marinette turned to look at adrien , she was blushing which somehow made the rainbow in her eyes grow brighter . adrien felt his chest constrict . “ yeah , it ’s amazing . ” kell , kell , kell the school bell rang , meaning there was only fifteen minutes left in class . “ what ? ” the two teens exclaimed in unison . both turned and began sprinting for their classroom “ we ’re late ! ” marinette cried . “ i think you mean , later than we were . ” adrien corrected . “ not to mention , we ’re sopping wet . ” marinette let out an exasperated sigh . this was going to be fun to try and explain . meanwhile , up in the waiting room . “ i ca n’t believe you did that . ” the boy stated flatly shaking his head . “ what do you mean ? ” the girl cocked her head to the side innocently as she finished closing the clouds back up . “ you made a rainbow , for one thing . ” the blonde began counting on his fingers , a deadpan look on his face . “ then you took it further by reflecting it off her eyes like that . and you were the one who made that girl slip in the first place . are you trying to get us demoted ? ” “ i ’m quite sure i do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ” the girl leaned close to her partner letting her eyes flutter a bit to play up her innocence . “ look , brie ” the boy put a hand on her shoulder and sighed . “ we ’re guardian angels . not cupid . ” the girl smirked up at her partner mischievously . “ you have n’t used that nickname in a while . was it seeing plagg that reminded you of it ? ” the boy turned away from the girl in an attempt to hide the blush creeping onto his cheeks . “ do n’t change the subject . ” his partner just giggled and hugged him from behind . “ i love you too , fe . ” thank you so much for reading ! ! : d i hope you enjoyed my little chapter for adrienette month ! ! you can also find this on ff.net here .</td>\n",

       "      <td>missafairy : memcjo : dettiot : fallingmeleth : adiwriting : barbex : inkshaming : so , i posted a fic today , and as i was setting up the ao3 post , i found myself writing in the end notes an impassioned - almost desperate , ngl - plea for comments . for interaction . and yeah , for validation too . because you know what ? writing is hard - despite commonly held misconceptions , it takes a shit - ton of effort to take some blank , empty void of a page and fill it with something   that lives and breathes and touches the minds and hearts of others .      and do n’t you dare wave that   “ you should be writing for yourself ” bullshit in my face . it ’s been a long , long time since i ’ve been able to do that , and honestly i ’m glad managed to recover as much as i have and write as much as i do . having an audience is an integral part of the writing process . let me repeat that . having an audience is an integral part of the writing process . we fanfic authors do n’t ask for much . as someone who is a published author , who has been published in a real physical book ™ and was paid hundreds of dollars in honest - to - god cold - hard cash for less work than i put into my fanfic , let me tell you , a few comments will not pay my tuition or buy my groceries or put clothes on my back . compared to the hours of labor that went into earning the money i was paid with , comments take substantially less time to create . and yet , to us , they are priceless . authors will create entire worlds for the sake of making a single person smile . you can be that person . we will write for you happily . you just have to let us know you care . and you ’d better do it soon . i ’ve heard too many authors all too willing to pull their tumblrs and erase or abandon their fics on ao3 because they have grown weary of screaming into the void . that fanfic you love ? gone . that chapter you ’re waiting for ? never gon na happen . how many of you have bookmark lists with fics already missing ? i bet you wo n’t even remember which one it is . you can keep that from happening . just write   “ omg thank you for updating , i really liked _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ! ” and fill in the blank . someone worked hard to put that smile on your face . you can make them smile in return . “ and do n’t you dare wave that “ you should be writing for yourself ” bullshit in my face . “ this so fucking much ! ! writers write to be read ! writers write to be read . oh my god , yes . because i ’ve heard far too many authors over the last few months talk about quitting writing over poor response ( or even worse- flaming ) . coming from an avid reader who was used to books and to not have anywhere to answer to the author , i ’m trying to get better at reviewing . but i do have a question for the authors :) . and it ’s a genuine one , no sarcasm or attack here . what kind of review do you like the most ? what motivates you more ? i ’ve heard some say they do n’t really like the   “ love it . please update soon ” generic one so i wondered since sometimes i ’m not sure what to say except   “ that was great . i loved it : ) ” . “ that was great . i loved it ” is fantastic , really .   if that ’s all you want to say , that works !   that tells me you enjoyed it .      if there was any bit that made you laugh out loud , or want to throw something at the screen , or you had to step back and take a break because you were just having all the feels – tell me that !   i think all authors loved knowing that our story matters to you – that it was n’t something you just skimmed while waiting to pick up your kids or at the doctor ’s office .   but even if you skimmed it , just saying   “ great job ! ” or   “ thanks for a great read ! ” makes an author ’s day . i admit , having the comment solely be   “ update soon ! ” is infuriating to me .   because i just posted .   like , even when i have a cushion of already - finished chapters , it ’s infuriating to me , because it makes me feel like i ’m a performing monkey . but other than this , pretty much any expression of enjoyment over my fics is fantastic .   :-) they do this for free you'all ! say thank you ! yeah , it ’s very sad :( i do n’t know if my fic is this bad or people just do n’t leave comments …        @ inkshaming    i do n’t know which fandom you write for since i do only arrow but please put up some links to your stories .   i know i will be happy to share them and i will go read your stories and post comments even if they are not arrow .   us writers need to stick together .</td>\n",

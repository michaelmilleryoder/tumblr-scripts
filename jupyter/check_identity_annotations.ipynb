For those of you who aren't into the world of sports, I'll do a quick introduction. The name's Adriana Clarington and I'm twenty-six years old. I work for ESPN as a sideline reporter, but in a year or two you can bet your ass I'll be the next Erin Andrews . Texan. That right there is all you need to know. If you want to to make me happy, bring me a Chipotle bowl with a glass of Pinot Noir.  The whole bottle is preferable.   \n",

       "3113555  Emma Coote My name is Emma, but most people call me Em, or Ems. I'm in year 4 at Hogwarts School for Witch Craft and Wizardry. I've recently turned fifteen, and I'm the daughter of Romilda Vane and Ritchie Coote. I just so happen to be a proud Gryffindor, and am an avid lover of all things green. I'm a part of the herbology club, so if you're ever looking for me, I can most likely be found in either the green house, outside, or in the library. I've got a cat named Gilly. She's very lazy, but is rather sassy, so if she does something, please tell me, and I'll try and remedy it as best I can. Other than that... If you want to know anything else, just let me know! My askbox is always open to those with good intentions. You're laughing with another boy, playing games with the stupid girls. You should know that I know this; still crushin' on you.   \n",

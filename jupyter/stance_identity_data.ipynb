I’m either stupid or you guys just can’t be tagged, but I don’t think you’ve blocked me as I can still see you blogs and shit.\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               For starters, as couple of you seemed rather pissed at me for titling my past post\\xa0“And respectfully,” let me tell you a little something. My\\xa0“respectfully” was meant to basically mean I respectfully disagree. You can disagree with something without automatically being a dick.\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               Also, you have seemed to miss the point of that post altogether. The point was to say I’m not going to lie to you about my views, but that I still think you deserve respect like everyone else. It was to show you some middle ground, that you could challenge me without me getting mean.\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               And to the one of you who called me a dick, and to the others who threw insults, that’s not how you change people’s minds. I know this must be something you are passionate about, but insulting people only pushes them away further. Actually, those who had replied and messaged me about their point of view NICELY have actually changed my mind a bit.\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               You’re right, otherkinity in itself is not delusional. Many of you seem quite right in the mind. But SOME are actually delusional, just a minority. With the points of view of those from the inside, those who respectfully sent in their disagrees, I came to that conclusion. You calling me a dick did not.\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               Basically, next time you want to change someones mind, trying being nice. I was trying to come from a place of respect to different views in hopes like people would trust me enough to tell me there side, which they did and I’m glad they did.\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               But I do get were you’re coming from, the frustration because some people in your community are delusional and because of that people think all of you are like that when you’re really not. Trust me, I understand the feeling greatly as being non-binary has the same thing happen to me. I tell people my identity and they immediately assume I’m some crazy bitch. So I get where you’re coming from, and why you are angry, but take my advice and try to be nice in disagrees. You’ll change a lot more minds that way\\n              </p>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n           </div>\\n           <div class=\"post-reblog-trail-item\">\\n            <div class=\"post-reblog-header\">\\n             <div class=\"post-avatar\">\\n              <div class=\"post-avatar-wrapper\">\\n               <a class=\"post-avatar-link sub-icon-reblog\" href=\"https://lycantheory.tumblr.com/post/160273387865/respectfully-again\" target=\"_blank\">\\n                <img class=\"post-avatar-image\" src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/avatar_a3ec0e09c41b_64.png\">\\n                </img>\\n               </a>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <a class=\"post-tumblelog-name\" href=\"https://lycantheory.tumblr.com/post/160273387865/respectfully-again\" target=\"_blank\">\\n              lycantheory\\n             </a>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"post-reblog-content\">\\n             <div class=\"post-body\">\\n              <p>\\n               I’ll be blunt. For someone who claims to be non-binary gendered to say “respectfully” and then go on to say you think a minority group is all delusional because of their identity seems to be the height of hypocrisy to me. Like I said before, it’s your view and it’s whatever, I’ll respect that it’s your opinion and I’ll defend your right to freedom of that expression as of it were my own but there’s a double standard here. \\n\\nNo concrete scientific evidence has been found to positively affirm or debunk that gender is even a thing so how can you throw stones when you live in a glass house, yourself? How can you honestly look in the mirror and throw one identity group under the blanket statement of being either delusional or faking it when the same could be said and probably has in regards to your own identity group? \\nIt seems as if your statements in “And Respectfully” were either not well thought out or you were attempting to show your obvious bias while ignoring the fact that you, yourself are in the same boat. I hold that “respectfully” was gaslighting and not an attempt to convey that you respectfully disagree due to the fact that the rest of your post was all about how you believe our identities to be invalid instead questioning how or why we experience the things we do in an attempt to further understand. \\nConstructive criticism is one thing “I can’t wrap my mind around X and I’d like someone to clarify this for me”, while inflammatory remarks are another “if you can prove your validity to me, that’ll be cool but until then I’m dismissing you as being mentally ill”. You mentioned having a toxic run-in with some fictionkin and I think that’s probably the root of your gripe with otherkin. I think you’re holding onto some bad blood and thus you might feel a need to belittle or dismiss someone over it, that’s just not cool. We aren’t the ones who’ve been toxic to you so if you’d actually like to entertain our views and perceptions, don’t do it by making inflamotory remarks.\\n Calling someone delusional and calling someone a dick… Both really serve the same purpose so you really have no ground to stand on getting bent out of shape about that. It happened, let’s move on and if you’re genuinely interested in who or how we experience the things we do, open your mind up and ask questions and consider our answers even if you do not find them adequate to suit. That’s how one should respectfully disagree…\\n              </p>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n           </div>\\n          </div>\\n         </div>\\n         <section

From what I’m aware, there are no such institutions of higher learning that have ever issues a degree on the subject and therefore, no one can rightfully claim to be an expert or a professional.\\n

          </p>\\n             <p>\\n              Of course, in order to have these discussions, one must be afforded a platform where independent thought and freedom of expression are fostered and individuals who are brazen enough to display it aren’t attacked by roaming hoards of lock-step conformists who flail in horror and shock at the slightest inclination that someone’s ideology may diverge from the norm.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              Perhaps this simply isn’t the correct platform for more advanced discussion of the concept…\\n             </p>\\n

class=\"post-reblog-content\">\\n               <div class=\"post-body\">\\n                <p>\\n                 As we move forward as a community and evolve and grow together as therians and kin, I’d like to take a step back and look at everything in perspective. We’ve come a long way since the days of A.H.W.W. and I often wonder why there is no prominent voice or collective of voices amongst therians and otherkin. Why do good communities seem to just die off after a while, after so many have proclaimed a desire to further the concept or present us to the outside world as being a credible and very real minority group of people?\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 I think much of this lies within our tendancy to focus a little too heavily on things like validity and what makes us the way we are. While it’s perfectly healthy to ask these questions and converse with others to try and answer them, I think we should put more focus on the community as a whole perhaps? After all, the closer we become and the more united we feel by the common bond that we all have will clearly show anyone on the outside that we are serious.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 Anyone with the proper knowledge and training can host a study, publish a research paper or author a book but to stand with one another, to learn and live and grow with each other is an experience that’s truly special and unique and I think we might need to take a few moments out of each day to remember that. I’m not saying that we should discard logic and fact in favor of sentiment and principle but I think the reason so many communities have failed or gone away is because the members of them are divided on what makes us unique…\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 We can be divided in ideology, that’s perfectly understandable. Ideology is subjective as per each individual because it’s rooted in perception but perhaps we should be placing our sense of unity above our own individual theories and ideas. I know it’s possible because I see it here. I’ve seen the staff go against their own personal beliefs in defense of others and I’ve seen other members surprise and astound me at how willing they are to accept someone who’s different, while maintaining their own respectful skepticism.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 I know I’m an optimist and I know I place a lot of value in hope and ideas and dreams or goals. If I, personally, ever lost hope or if I began to view the world only considering likely outcomes instead of looking beyond the likely and aiming for the spectacular, I don’t think I’d be very please to to be around to be honest. Despite my optimisim, I’m also very prone to over-analyze things and look at the world from more of a realistic perspective.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 Anyhow, we’ve really got something special here on TG. I’ve never seen such a diverse and unique group of people, therians, kin, kith, or just those that are curious come together and find such strength in what unites us. We aren’t perfect, none of us are, and were bound to have controversial debates over things, we’re bound to disagree and if we are completely honest with each other and ourselves, we’re bound to be judgemental sometimes, if even it’s limited to a fleeting thought.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 But we’re all TG. Despite our flaws and biases and quirks and habits. None of us is any more right about anything than the other, none of us any more credible or valid or true. We’re all on the same level even if our experiences and our perceptions may be polar opposite. Even if some of us tend to fall into certain roles, even if those that do are exceedingly good at it, no one is more important than anyone else and the experiences of someone who’s just learned about therianrhropy and joined yesterday should be considered just as equal to the experiences of someone such as myself.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 There’s character, of course.. some people just aren’t genuine but I haven’t seen much of a problem with that, here. Those who are not genuine in their feelings or experiences don’t tend to hang around long, if at all.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 My point is… If we stand together and never lose sight of the importance of our community, I whole-heartedly believe that TG can withstand what other online communities have not. I believe we can pass even the test of time. That belief isn’t rooted in Dust’s or my own ability to run and maintain the site, it isn’t even rooted in my faith in the best staff I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. That belief is rooted and survives in each and every one of you…\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 Thank you all for making this such a great community!\\n

        <div class=\"body-text\">\\n             <p>\\n              Before I begin, I would like to clarify that I don’t typically like the use of labels, especially when discussing something that seems to vary as per individual experience such as therianthropy. I will, however use labeling here for the sole purpose of trying to convey my thoughts in somewhat of a universal fashion.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              I have been a wolf suntherian for as long as I can remember, even though it took me 12 years to discover what I was and another 10 years or so to actually define being a wolf therian. My earliest memories are of wandering around in the wild, the forest and the bank of a river with a certain curiosity that felt non-human in nature. I’ve always loved chewing stuff up, rolling in grass or mud, running, playing outside in the sun or pouring rain. Since I can remember, I have had a shyness/distrust towards humans, only letting my guard down to a few select ones after approaching them with extreme caution. Growing up, I always knew that I was different from my peers but I could never quite put my finger on what made me so different. I looked the same as them, was surrounded by the same type of environment most of the time, influenced by the same sources often, yet, there was a stark difference between us. I knew that I didn’t feel as comfortable around humans as I did animals and that I far preferred to be alone in the wilderness than in a typical human social setting.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              Going into my teenage years, I came to the realization that I was a wolf and I’ll elaborate on how I came to this conclusion a bit more here than I did in my journal. I was in 7th grade, middle school, having a rough time coping with everyday life and my social environment. Every minute of every day that I was not alone in the wild felt to me like I was trapped or being held captive in a hostile environment. I spent many of my waking hours in fight or flight mode, always anxious, always ready to snarl and fight to defend myself. It was around this time that I began reading immensely to escape from reality. I got pretty heavy into ancient mythology, science and physics and biology. Any book I could find on those topics was opened inside my textbooks and I was often lost in a story or a theory or thinking about how things worked. My favorite escape from reality, however, came in the form of reading about wildlife that suffered dramatically due to human impact and how such wildlife was still able to adapt and survive despite human development. When I first started reading about wolves and their behaviors, history, the theories of how they befriended early humans, I got a strange feeling of pride that I can only compare to someone reading about one’s family history or some such. The more I learned and explored into the world of wolves the more I began to realize similarities between wolves and myself. At this point, had that point in my life been in modern times, I would have probably googled “I feel like a wolf” or something similar but the internet was still in it’s infancy to a large extent and there were no therian communities to turn to.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              I began daydreaming heavily about being a wolf, to the point where I could sort of lost all concept of reality and picture myself as a wolf, running through the grass, through the woods. It became so real to me that I could “feel” mud on my paws and I could feel my ears move on top of my head when I was lost in this alternate reality inside my mind. Today, I would consider these early sensory phenomenon to be the beginning of phantom shifting. Back then I didn’t know what to make of it other than a feeling of euphoria because it just felt so much like what I should be feeling and not what I was feeling (if that makes any sense). Being the stubborn and strong willed animal that I am, I couldn’t accept not acting on my impulse to do what a wolf would do so I began reading books about wilderness survival and would often go “camping” on the weekends with little more than some form of blade and a source of fire. The allure of feeling the woods beneath my bare feet would teach me many lessons, including the very important fact that, while I knew I felt like a wolf, I still had a human body. When I got my first dog I was extremely excited because, while she was not a wolf, she seemed to be a bridge between the human and canine world. I spent a lot of time with her and learned much about why I had some of the reactions that I did to certain things. Not only did she teach me so much about how to canine but we developed an unbreakable bond with each other to the point where I felt that she was the only living thing that I could trust. The more I plunged into feeling like a wolf, the more I withdrew from society and the more trouble it caused me but, at the same time, the less I cared about what trouble arose.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              Let me stop here and reflect on a few things regarding how I feel they pertain to therianthropy.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              1. My first indicator that something was different about me was a pretty stark difference between the traits, behaviors, emotions, reactions of myself and my peers.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              2. When I began educating myself about my theriotype animal, it felt almost as if I was studying my own heritage or something. The feeling of pride and understanding seemed to resonate with me on a level that it shouldn’t have if I were “typical” or “normal”\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              3. I found that animal reactions, instincts, traits, behaviors made much more sense to me than did human ones.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              4. I had experienced some sensations of phantom shifting while daydreaming about being my theriotype animal.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              5. I found it easier to bond with and relate to canines than humans\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              Now while I’m not, in any way, attempting to establish guidelines for being therian. If one were to notice similar aspects as those aforementioned, I believe that therianthropy should at least be considered on the path of self-exploration, even if one were to only exhibit two or three aspects of themselves that could indicate therianthropy. Moving forward in my personal experience, I found that I eventually developed an urge to forge bonds with humans as well. The first real friends that I ever made were in high school, it took some time before I trusted them completely but once I did I quickly developed an urge to provide for and protect them where it was needed. I would say that this turned into more than just friendship because I stood with them, without regard for myself, through good times and through the worst days anyone could imagine. While I don’t necessarily know if this could be considered a pack mentality or not, it gave me a great deal of comfort and pride to think of it as such. Despite having a few very close friends, I still had the urge to find a different type of relationship and this urge was about to become overpowering and, strangely enough, would lead me to disconnect with my theriotype and teach me a very hard lesson.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              I won’t go into great detail about the first girl I was involved with in a relationship because it’s not really relevant to therianthropy but.will say that I had some very intense feelings for her that wound up not being quite mutual and it ended in heartbreak for me. The depression and dissatisfaction with myself that I experienced following this lead me to want a “normal” life even though I had come to the conclusion long ago that I was anything but “normal”. I did the best I could to ignore my canine impulses, cover up all of my traits, repress all of my urges to act like a wolf or anything other than a “typical” human. I basically lied to myself every day about who and what I was in an attempt to be accepted for something that I was not. This constant battle and inner turmoil turned me into one of the most miserable and hateful individuals that one might imagine. In the end, I did manage to somewhat force a disconnect which lead me to feeling empty and hollow inside, like I was no longer anything but a shell of a being with no purpose, no defenition, nobody surrounded me anymore because I had turnedinto something that was not me. It wasn’t long before the void that I had created within became filled with darkness. Pain, sorrow, fear and endless doubt and hopelessness became my life. With nothing positive left to carry on for I came to a crossroads. I could put an end to it all or embrace who and what I knew, deep inside, I still was. Well, I’m still here and I’m still a wolf.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              In closing, I don’t attribute the hardships I have endured to being therian but I do attribute some of my ability to adapt and overcome them to it. I see therianthropy as a phenomenon that is as beautiful as it is perplexing. I don’t consider myself ane less of a human because I am a therian, nor do I consider myself and less of a wolf because I exist as a human in a human society. The human side of me is intellectual and has great capacity but it is weak in several aspects. The wolf side of me is powerful and driven by instinct, yet it lacks the ability to manuver through complex human social situations and it’s guard is always up to the point of keeping me somewhat paranoid. Each side of me is flanked by the other and both human and wolf work as a very close team to the same goals. I believe that from years of this, my human side has become more canine in nature and I believe that my wolf side has adapted to existing in a human world to some extent. I’m very proud of who and what I am, I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.\\n             </p>\\n             <p>\\n              A few final words for anyone who reads this… Be proud of yourself, never stop learning about who and what you are. I can’t explain why we are the way we are but I do know that we are something very unique and that in itself is a wonderful thing…\\n             </p>\\n            </div>\\n           </div>\\n

older therians and otherkin have gone? Sure, life is hectic and those that have decided to settle down and raise a family or embark upon demanding careers or other endeavors they may be passionate about probably don’t have time to contribute to the online community like they used to.\\n\\nOne thing that certainly doesn’t help matters much, however, is all the drama, the “fluff” (people who aren’t serious about therianthropy but take it as roleplay or a game or something they choose to label as for no sake other than to feel special) and those rabid elitists that stand high upon their pedestals, knighting who is the purest of the pure therians and exiling everyone else by their classic proclamations “that’s got nothing to do with therianthropy!”.\\n\\nHere, at Therian Guide, we aren’t elitist but we do take everyone’s individual experience of therianthropy very seriously. We aren’t like most communities on social media, were more like a family that comes together each week or every day to lend our support to each other, offer our experiences so that someone may take something from them and just generally enjoy being around others who share much in common.\\n\\nWe take care of each other, we reach out to find and take in new members who might feel lost or alone. We reach out to try and make a difference in the world with our charity efforts, we’ll even put a shirt on your back, with our logo on it, if you need or a hoodie or blanket if it’s cold out.\\n\\nIf you’re serious about your non-human identity and you’re disgusted with the fickle, fluffy and full of shit*t therian/kin communities on social media, give us a try. We come from all walks of life, young, old, professional, students, homemakers, scholors, you name it.\\n\\nTo those that are lost, that want a safe-haven, who want to learn what being a therian means to us, instead of being told how therianthropy should apply to you, our doors are open.\\n                </p>\\n               </div>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n

I’ll also note that I currently hold a field management position in a fortune 250 company and my gross income averages around $55,000usd a year so please cast your frustration with your own life

       Otherkin, I’m always gonna give you a ton of crap. Yeah, I think you guy’s are all either delusional or faking it, and your all in need some serious therapy. But really? I don’t think you’re bad people. A lot of you seem really nice, I’m just not gonna beat around the bush about my views just because of that. Yeah, I think you guys are really cringy a lot of the time, but eh we’re all cringy to someone. And I may have a bone to pick with some fictionkin, the very toxic ones, but that doesn’t mean I think they or any of you deserved to have your life threatened. Hell man, most of you are just kids, you shouldn’t be being told that kind of shit.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 Still, I think it would be rather two faced of me to not be honest about my views on otherkin just because you guys aren’t evil.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 And finally, don’t be afraid to challenge me. I actually enjoy hearing different points of view. And fuck man, if you can prove me wrong or convince me otherkin isn’t just a delusion, then I’ll thank you. Because otherkin being real would be cool as fuck, but I won’t believe in it just because it’s cool.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                 -Mod Amethyst\\n                </p>\\n               </div>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"post-reblog-trail-item\">\\n              <div class=\"post-reblog-header\">\\n               <div class=\"post-avatar\">\\n                <div class=\"post-avatar-wrapper\">\\n                 <a class=\"post-avatar-link sub-icon-reblog\" href=\"https://lycantheory.tumblr.com/post/160225374045/and-respectfully\" target=\"_blank\">\\n                  <img class=\"post-avatar-image\" src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/avatar_a3ec0e09c41b_64.png\">\\n                  </img>\\n                 </a>\\n                </div>\\n               </div>\\n               <a class=\"post-tumblelog-name\" href=\"https://lycantheory.tumblr.com/post/160225374045/and-respectfully\" target=\"_blank\">\\n                lycantheory\\n               </a>\\n              </div>\\n              <div class=\"post-reblog-content\">\\n               <div class=\"post-body\">\\n                <p>\\n                 Let me preface this by saying that using words like “cringy” doesn’t lend the notion that your argument is rooted in much structured thought on the issue but rather suggests that you’re merely parroting the emotional, knee-jerk reaction of most of society in all of it’s conformist glory. With that being said, what leads you to believe that we are delusional when there are many of us, well into mid-life that are very successful professionals with degrees of some form or other and some of our communities have been able to obtain what your precious “normal” society has not… Acceptance of others, understanding before judgement, goodwill toward others, kindness instead of ridicule, compassion. I hardly think that such merits can be obtained by delusional folks who’s thoughts and perceptions are based in fiction. We have to have an understanding of others and of ourselves, we have to have a heightened awareness to notice what makes us different , we have to have the cognitive ability to contrast and compare and therefore we are not delusional, I can guarantee you.\\n\\nFaking it? I wish. My life would be so much easier, as would many of our lives, of we did not experience these urges, mannerisms, dysphoria, instinctual responses and the like. I’m not really social and could care less about the how I am perceived by others, rather it’s as being something special or not although I will acknowledge that there are some in the otherkin community that aren’t serious and do seem to wear the identity as a mask for various reasons but it’s hardly fair for one to make such an assessment of an entire group based off of the worst examples therein.\\n\\nWe are not mostly kids, we come from all walks of life but those who’ve grown up have other things to attend to than being heavily involved online and thus the appearance of such an overwhelming majority being younger. Also, the teenage years are when most begin to seriously question identity and It’s no secret that some do find that they aren’t therian/otherkin as they question deeper.\\n\\nYour opinion seems to be in lock-step with the rest who’ve been indoctrinated into the degenerate, fickle, superficial, steriotyping mass of bigotry, judgement and fear that I know as society… You’re entitled to follow who and believe what you wish. My only challenge to you would be to cast aside what you’ve been taught and think for yourself, ask real questions instead of making broad statements and be willing to discuss instead of levy judgement. You’ll gain knowledge and insight that way and you won’t have to gaslight us by prefacing your criticism with “Respectfully…”\\n                </p>\\n               </div>\\n              </div>\\n
